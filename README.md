This is my very first ebook based on R Markdown and **bookdown**. I combined those tools with LaTeX, Python, and GitHub, and everything runs smoothly. I am excited to share the result with all of you guys. I hope it is helpful somehow!

The ebook is rendered [here](https://zolabar.github.io/ebook_che5314_ucv/).
