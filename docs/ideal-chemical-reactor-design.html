<p>Process design has to do with specific matters relating to the process itself, in our cases, such as operation conditions, size, configuration, and operation mode of the reactor.</p>

<p>In this course, we will focus on the phenomena taking place in basic reactor types.</p>
<p>The phenomena occurring in a reactor may be broken down into reaction, mass, heat, and momentum transfer. Therefore, reactors’ modeling and design are based on the reaction rate equation, the continuity, energy, and momentum equations. The modeling and design of reactors are based on the equations describing these phenomena: the reaction rate equation and the continuity, energy, and momentum equations <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-froment2011" role="doc-biblioref">Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will study two situations (1) the design of a new chemical reactor for a new process, (2) the analysis of the performance of an existing reactor for a current process. In many cases, as chemical engineers, we must consider several items shown in figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:mindmap">2.1</a> when starts the design or analysis of a reactor.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Material Balance</h3>
<p>As a chemical engineer, our main modeling tools are the material balance and energy balance. We should remember two aspects: the material balance of a reactor must consider the rate at which species are converted from one chemical form to another and the rate at which energy is transformed by the process.</p>
<p>We will perform a mole balance on species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in a system volume, where <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> represents the particular chemical species of interest.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.2: System volume scheme
</p>
</div>
<p>Based on figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:arbitrarysystem">2.2</a>, the mole balance expressed in mole/time would be</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:continuidad">\[\begin{equation}
 F_{j0}  +  G_j   - {F_j } =  \frac{dN_j}{dt}
\tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(F_{j0}\)</span> is rate flow in <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(G_j\)</span> is the generation rate of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> by chemical reaction, <span class="math inline">\(F_{j}\)</span> is rate flow out <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(dN_j/dt\)</span> means accumulation rate of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>In equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:continuidad">(2.1)</a>, the generation/consumption of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(G_j\)</span>) will be expressed as the product of the reaction volume, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, and the rate of reaction, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>The symbol <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is expressed in molar units per unit time and volume, and it is always <strong>positive</strong> when the reaction proceeds in the direction of the arrow. Thus, the integral form of the general mole balance for any chemical specie <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> yields.
<span class="math display" id="eq:genbal">\[\begin{equation}
  F_{j0} - F_j + \int_{0}^V {r_j\,dV} = \frac{dN_j}{dt}
  \tag{2.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In mathematical terms, the equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:genbal">(2.2)</a> is called the continuity equation for <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> reacts in more than one phase, such an equation is needed for each phase. This equation will develop the design equations for different ideal reactors: batch, semi-batch, and continuous-flow.</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> can enter or leave the volume element are flow and molecular diffusion, and they are irrelevant. However, it is essential to realize that a fluid’s motion is not really ordered and challenging to describe.</p>
<p>For this reason, as a first approach, it is therefore natural to consider two extreme conceptual cases: first, where there is no mixing of the streamlines, and second, where the mixing is complete. These two extremes may be formulated with sufficient approximation by the tubular plug flow reactor, and the continuous flow stirred tank with complete mixing.</p>
<p>In a plug flow reactor, all fluids elements move with equal velocity along parallel streamlines. The plug flow is the only mechanism for mass transport, and there is no mixing between fluid elements. The reaction leads to a concentration gradient in the axial flow direction.</p>
<p>Reactors with complete mixing may be subdivided into batch and continuous types. In batch-reactor types with complete mixing, the composition is uniform throughout the reactor. Consequently, the continuity equations may be written for the entire contents, not over a volume element. As the bulk composition varies with time, a first-order ordinary differential equation is obtained, with time as a variable. The form of this equation is analogous to that for the plug flow case.</p>
<p>In the continuous flow type, an element of the entering fluid is instantaneously mixed with the reactor’s contents so that it loses its identity. This type also operates at a constant concentration level. In the steady-state, the continuity equations are algebraic.</p>
<p>Both types of continuous reactors considered are idealized conceptual cases. They are important cases because they are easy to calculate and give the extreme values of the conversions between those realized in a real reactor. With its intermediate level of mixing, the design of a real reactor requires information about this mixing.<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-froment2011" role="doc-biblioref">Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011</a>)</span></p>
</div>
<div id="energy-balance" class="section level3" number="2.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Energy Balance</h3>
<p>The real chemical reactors are almost operated under nonisothermal conditions because reactions generate or absorb large amounts of heat. Detailed reactor sizing and analysis require the energy balance to be solved in conjunction with one or more material balances.</p>
<p>For a generic open system, the energy balance is:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
 Q -  {W_s} + \dot{H}_\text{in} - \dot{H}_\text{out}  =  \frac{dE}{dt}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>The terms in energy balances have the following meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the rate of heat transfer <strong>into</strong> the reactor.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(W_s\)</span> means the rate at which shaft work is done by the system on the surrounding. If shaft work is done on the contents of the reactor, e.g., by an agitator, the value of <span class="math inline">\(W_s\)</span> is negative.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\dot{H}_\text{in}\)</span> is the rate at which enthalpy is transported into the reactor.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\dot{H}_\text{out}\)</span> is the rate at which enthalpy is transported out of the reactor.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(dE/dt\)</span> is the rate at which the system’s total energy, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, changes with time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In chemical reactors, it is typically assumed the internal energy is the dominant contribution over the kinetic and potential energies. Thus, the general energy balance will be</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:energybal">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{dU}{dt}= Q - W_s + \dot{H}_{\text{in}} - \dot{H}_\text{out}
  \tag{2.3}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>For single reactors, the inlet and outlet molar flow are related through the extents of reaction (<span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>). If “<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>” independent reactions occur, and if the extents of reaction are zero in the stream that enters the reactor.<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-roberts2009" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts 2009</a>)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  F_i - F_{i0} = {\sum}_{j=1}^{R} \nu_{j,i}\,\xi_j
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{j,i}\)</span> refers to stoichiometric coefficient of the component  in the reaction .</p>
<p>Therefore,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\dot{H}_{\text{in}} - \dot{H}_{\text{out}} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\,\overline{H}_{i0} - {{\sum_{i=1}^\mathcal{C}}} \left(F_{i0} + \sum_{j=1}^{R} \nu_{j,i}\,\xi_j\right)\,\overline{H}_i
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\overline H_i\)</span> refers to the partial molar enthalpy of the component .</p>
<p>Assuming that feed and product streams are ideal solutions, the partial molar enthalpies <span class="math inline">\(\overline{H}_i\)</span> can be replaced by pure component enthalpies, <span class="math inline">\(H_i\)</span>, Thus,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\dot{H}_{\text{in}} - \dot{H}_{\text{out}} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\,\left({H}_{i0} - H_i\right) - {{\sum_{j=1}^R}} \xi_j\,\left(\sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal{C}} \nu_{i,j}\,{H}_i (T)\right)
\end{equation*}\]</span>
The term <span class="math inline">\(\sum \nu_{i,j}\,{H}^\circ_i\)</span> is just the enthalpy of reaction for reaction <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, evaluated at exit conditions. Since the temperature of the effluent stream is <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal{C}} \nu_{i,j}\,{H}_i = \Delta H_{R,j}(T)
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_{R_j}(T)\)</span> is the heat of reaction <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, evaluated at the temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the pressure difference between the feed and the product streams is not substancial, and if there are no phase changes
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  H_{i0} - H_i = \int_T^{T_0} {C_{P_i}\,dT} \approx \overline{C}_{P_i} \left(T_0 - T\right)
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where, <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> is the temperature of the inlet stream, <span class="math inline">\(C_{P_i}\)</span> is the constant-pressure molar heat capacity of specie <em>i</em>, and <span class="math inline">\(\overline{C}_{P_i}\)</span> is the average constant-pressure molar heat capacity over the temperature range <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span></p>
<p>So, eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:energybal">(2.3)</a> becomes to
<span class="math display" id="eq:energybala">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{dU}{dt}= Q - W_s - \sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} \left(F_{i0}\,\int_{T_0}^{T} {C_{P_i}\,dT}\right) - {\sum_{j=1}^R} \xi_j\,\Delta H_{R,j}(T)
\tag{2.4}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:energybala">(2.4)</a> is the energy balance for a whole reactor in which multiple reactions are taken place. In this equation, the term <span class="math inline">\(\left(\sum F_{i0}\,\int{C_{P_i}\,dT}\right)\)</span> represents the rate of sensible heat, and it is usually written on a <strong>molar</strong> basis. The term <span class="math inline">\(\sum \xi_j\,\Delta H_{R,j}(T)\)</span>), means the heat rate (generated or consumed) related to the reaction.<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-roberts2009" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts 2009</a>)</span></p>
<p>If only one reaction is taking place, eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:energybala">(2.4)</a> can be written in terms of the fractional conversion. For a single reaction, where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a reactant,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \xi = - \frac{F_{A0} - F_A}{\nu_A} = - \frac{F_{A0}\,X_A}{\nu_A}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting this relationship into eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:energybala">(2.4)</a> and assuming steady-state condition gives <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-roberts2009" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts 2009</a>)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:energybalb">\[\begin{equation}
 Q - W_s - \sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} \left(F_{i0}\,\int_{T_0}^{T} {C_{P_i}\,dT}\right) + F_{A0}\,X_A\,\frac{\Delta H_{R}(T)}{\nu_A} = 0

<p>When plug flow is postulated, it is natural to accept that the concentration in a section perpendicular to flow is considered to be uniform. It is natural to also consider the temperature to be uniform in this section.

This also implies that the resistance to heat transfer in the central core is zero in a direction perpendicular to the flow, which is not right for certain catalytic reactors.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The Continuous-Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR)</h2>
<p>When the demand for a single chemical product reaches a high level, there will be an economic incentive to continuously manufacture it, using a reactor dedicated to that product. One of those is The <em>Continuous-Stirred-Tank Reactor or CSTR</em>.</p>
<p><img src="ebook_notes_5314_files/figure-html/cstrdraw-1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The CSTR is a well-mixed vessel consisting of a baffled tank with mixing induced by an impeller and operates at a steady-state. The mass flow rate into the tank is equal to the mass flow rate out of it at steady-state, and the feed and product properties are not functions of time. Furthermore, the reactor volume is constant.</p>
<p>A well-mixed vessel means a working fluid with neither radial, axial, nor angular gradients in properties. In other words, both the composition and temperature of the fluid are uniform over the entire volume. That is, they do not vary with position. Those assumptions are</p>
<p>The central assumption is that the incoming fluid concentration will become instantaneously equal to outgoing upon entering the vessel. As a consequence of well-mixing behavior, the effluent stream must have precisely the same composition and temperature as the contents of the reactor. The feed must be immediately mixed with the reactor’s contents in a time interval that is very small compared to the mean residence time of the fluid flowing through the vessel to meet this ideal mixing pattern. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-froment2011" role="doc-biblioref">Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011</a>)</span></p>
<p>The CSTR is frequently chosen when temperature control is a critical aspect when the conversion must occur at constant composition, when a reaction between two phases has to be carried out, or when a catalyst must be kept in suspension. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-froment2011" role="doc-biblioref">Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011</a>)</span></p>

<p>In practice, it is possible to reach a perfect mixing condition if the mixing time is much less than the residence time inside the reactor, usually when the fluid is low viscosity.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> The design equation for a CSTR</h3>
<p>An ideal CSTR is quite similar to a perfectly mixed batch reactor. The most significant difference is that mass flows into and out of a CSTR. Thus, the mass flow in and out of the reactor in eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:continuidad">(2.1)</a> will not cancel.</p>
<p>Writing the material balance for this system:
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq002028a">\[\begin{equation}
    \frac{dN_j}{dt} = F_{\text{in},j} - F_{j} + r_j V
    \tag{2.6}

<p>At steady-state, the left-hand side of eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq002028a">(2.6)</a> is zero, thus
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq002028b">\[\begin{gather}

<p>Equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq002028b">(2.7)</a> is <strong>the design equation</strong> for an ideal CSTR. For a single reaction, it is useful to write it down in terms of the conversion of reactant A.

<p>If a high conversion is desired, the reactant concentration must be small. But the reaction rate depends directly on the reactant concentration, so to compensate for this restriction, we must design larger reactors.</p>

<h4>Constant-Density System</h4>

    \tag{2.9}
\end{gather}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(C_{0,j}\)</span> is the concentration of specie <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> at initial conditions, <span class="math inline">\(C_j\)</span> is the concentration into the reactor, and <span class="math inline">\(\overline t\)</span> is used to refer to the <strong>mean residence time</strong>, which is given by

    \tag{2.10}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\upsilon\)</span> is the volumetric flow rate evaluated at exit conditions.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(X_{A,\text{in}} = 0\)</span>, the effluent volumetric flow rate can be related to inlet flow rate by

    \upsilon = \upsilon_0 \left( 1 + \nu\, X_A \right)
    \tag{2.11}

where <span class="math inline">\(\upsilon_0\)</span> is the volumetric flow rate evaluated at entrance conditions, and <span class="math inline">\(\nu = \sum\nolimits_j \nu_j\)</span></p>
<p>Since the volumetric flow rate is a function of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, the mean residence time, <span class="math inline">\(\overline t\)</span>, depends on those variables. Instead of using the reactor residence time to describe performance, an equal quantity called <strong>space-time</strong> define as:
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq002033">\[\begin{equation}
    \tau = \frac{V}{\upsilon_0}
    \tag{2.12}
\end{equation}\]</span>
This definition of space-time applies to any continuous reactor.</p>
<p>For a homogeneous reaction, space-time has the dimension of time. It is related to the average time a volume element of fluid spends in the reactor.</p>
<p>Although space-time is not necessarily equal to the mean residence time, they behave similarly, and it is possible to relate eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq002032">(2.10)</a> and eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq002033">(2.12)</a>

    \overline t = \frac{\tau}{1 + \varepsilon_A\, X_A}
    \tag{2.13}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>If the volume change in the reactor is negligible, then <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_A = 0\)</span>. Finally, if the working fluid has constant density
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq002034">\[\begin{gather}
    V = \frac{\left(C_{A0} - C_A\right) \upsilon}{r_A}  \notag \\
    \overline t = \tau
    \tag{2.14}
\end{gather}\]</span></p>
<p>Space-time influences reaction behavior in a continuous reactor in the same way that real-time does on a batch reactor’s behavior. In both cases, the fractional conversion will increase if reactants spend more time or space-time increases.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the fluid density is constant, eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq002031">(2.8)</a> becomes
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

<p>The equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq002031">(2.8)</a> may be interpreted graphically from a plot of reciprocal rate <span class="math inline">\(1/(−r_A)\)</span> as function of <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span>, as shown by curve EB in fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig002011">2.3</a>.

<p>Another parameter commonly used for CSTR design is the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, called <strong>space velocity</strong>, which can be regarded as the number of reactor volumes of feed processed per unit time at the feed conditions.

<p>When the rectangle <em>KLMN</em> is made as large as possible, the overall volume is minimized. Therefore, point <span class="math inline">\(X_{A1}\)</span> is the critical parameter to get the reactors’ optimal size.</p>
<p>For reaction rate expressions of the _n_th-order form, it can be shown that there is always one and only one point that minimizes the total volume when <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;0\)</span>. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-hill2014" role="doc-biblioref">Hill and Root 2014</a>)</span></p>
<p>The total reaction volume is:
<span class="math display" id="eq:totalVolume">\[\begin{equation}
V_1 + V_2 = F_{A0}\:\frac{X_{A1}}{(-r_A)_1} + F_{A0}\:\frac{X_{A2} - X_{A1}}{(-r_A)_2}
\tag{2.22}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The derivative of eq. #ref(eq:totalVolume) respects to <span class="math inline">\(X_{A1}\)</span> is:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{d\:\left(V_1 + V_2\right)}{dX_{A1}} = \frac{F_{A0}}{(-r_A)_1} + F_{A0}\:X_{A1}\left(\frac{d\:\left(1/(-r_A)_1\right)}{dX_{A1}}\right) - \frac{F_{A0}}{(-r_A)_2} = 0
\end{equation}\]</span>
simplifying leads to
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{d\left(1/(-r_A)_1\right)}{dX_{A1}} = \frac{1/(-r_A)_2 - 1/(-r_A)_1}{dX_{A1}}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the minimum reaction volume will be found when the intermediate fractional conversion <span class="math inline">\(X_{A1}\)</span> is selected. The slope of the reaction rate curve at this conversion level is equal to the slope of the rectangle’s diagonal KLMN, as is shown in figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:CSTRseriesminV">2.9</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Energy Balance</h3>
<p>Now let us find out how to apply the general energy balance (eq.<a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:energybal">(2.3)</a>) to a CSTR. Usually, for an ideal CSTR operating at a steady-state (<span class="math inline">\(dU/dt = 0\)</span>), it is considered the work done by the stirrer neglected, so the energy balance yields to:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ec003017">\[\begin{equation}

<p>Using the energy balance to analyze the performance or sizing an ideal CSTR is not as complicated mathematically, so let us consider some typical heat transfer modes.</p>
<div id="jacket-cooled" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Jacket-Cooled</h4>
<p>Consider the ideal CSTR shown in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003005a">2.10</a>. Heat is added to or removed from the reactor by a heat-transfer fluid that flows through the jacket.
Depending on the reactor temperature and whether the reactor is being heated or cooled, the heat-transfer fluid may be cooling water, chilled brine, chilled glycol solution, hot oil, or some other fluid. The fluid is a source of (or a sink for) the heat transferred through the reactor wall.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:fig003005a"></span>
<img src="ebook_notes_5314_files/figure-html/fig003005a-1.png" alt="Schematic diagram of an ideal CSTR with heat transfer through a heating/cooling jacket" width="40%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.10: Schematic diagram of an ideal CSTR with heat transfer through a heating/cooling jacket
</p>
</div>
<p>The transit energy rate is <span class="math inline">\(\dot{W}\)</span>. The temperature of the fluid at a point in the jacket is <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>. The fluid enters the jacket at <span class="math inline">\(T_{c,i}\)</span> and leaves at <span class="math inline">\(T_{c,o}\)</span>. The feed enters the reactor at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>. The molar flow rates of each component of the feed are designated <span class="math inline">\(F_{i,0}\)</span>, and its corresponding concentrations are designated <span class="math inline">\(C_{i,0}\)</span>. The reactor operates at a temperature, <em>T</em>, which is the effluent temperature too. The molar flow rates in the output stream are designated <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span>, and the corresponding concentrations are <span class="math inline">\(C_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>If a single reaction occurs in a CSTR and one mole of reactant <em>A</em> is consumed in an elemental first-order reaction, the eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003020a">(2.28)</a> yields to:
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003020a">\[\begin{equation}
Q - \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\,\overline{C}_{p,i}\right)\left(T - T_0\right) - F_{A0}\,X_A \, \Delta H_{R}(T) = 0
\tag{2.28}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The <em>Q</em> term in eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003020a">(2.28)</a> depends on the removal scheme used. In general, the rate for heat transfer is:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    q = U \left(T_c - T\right)
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where: <em>q</em> is the heat flux into the reactor <span class="math inline">\(\left(\text{J}/\text{m}^2-\text{h}\right)\)</span>, and <em>U</em> means the overall heat-transfer coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\left(\text{J}/\text{m}^2-\text{h}-\text{K}\right)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(T&lt;Tc\)</span>, heat is transferred into the reactor and <span class="math inline">\(q&gt;0\)</span>. The total heat transfer rate, <em>Q</em>, is obtained by integrating the flux, <em>q</em>, over the whole area of the exchanger. For example, if the temperature of the fluid is the same at every point in the exchanger.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    Q = U\,A_{J} \left(\overline{T}_c - T\right)
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{T}_c\)</span> is the constant temperature of the heat-transfer fluid, and it is equal to the outlet temperature, <span class="math inline">\(T_{c,o}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_J\)</span> is the total area of the heat exchanger.</p>
<p>Substituting in <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003020a">(2.28)</a>,
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003021">\[\begin{equation}
- F_{A0}\,X_A \, \Delta H_{R}(T)
= U\,A_{J} \left(T - T_c\right) + \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\,\overline{C}_{p,i}\right)\left(T - T_0\right)
\tag{2.29}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>To understand the physical meaning of the terms in eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003021">(2.29)</a>, consider an exothermic reaction. The term <span class="math inline">\(\left[- F_{A0}\,X_A \, \Delta H_{R}^\circ(T)\right]\)</span> represents the enthalpy change related to change in composition because of the chemical reaction. While <span class="math inline">\(U\,A_{J} \left(T - T_c\right)\)</span> is the rate at which heat is transferred out of the CSTR. Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\,\overline{C}_{p,i}\right)\left(T - T_0\right)\)</span> represents the increase in sensible heat of the feed as it goes from <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> to <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>Now, we define two functions corresponding to the left-hand side and right-hand of eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003021">(2.29)</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>The first function is:
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003022">\[\begin{equation}
 HPR(T) = - F_{A0}\,X_A\,\Delta H_R(T)
 \tag{2.30}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The function <em>HPR(T)</em> represents the **heat generation* rate in the reactor, proportional to the reaction heat (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_R\)</span>) and conversion degree (<span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span>). For an exothermic reaction, this term will be &gt; 0 and a strong temperature function.</p>
<p>The second function, <em>HWR(T)</em>, is defined from two right-hands terms of the eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003023">(2.31)</a>.
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003023">\[\begin{equation}
HWR(T)  = UA_{J} \left(T - T_c\right) + \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\,\overline{C}_{p,i}\right)\left(T - T_0\right)
\tag{2.31}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Eq <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003023">(2.31)</a> is called the <strong>removal</strong> term because it represents the total heat transfer rate per unit volume of the reaction mixture. In summary, it represents the sensible heat from <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> to <em>T</em> and the heat transferred to the heat-transfer fluid.</p>
<p>Both <em>HPR(T)</em> and <em>HWR(T)</em> allow identifying when the CSRT operates under steady-state conditions and which of them is stable. If <em>HPR(T)</em> <span class="math inline">\(\neq\)</span> <em>HWR(T)</em>, the CSTR is <strong>not</strong> at steady-state.</p>

</div>
<p>The intersection of the <em>HPR(T)</em> curve with the <em>HWR(T)</em> line is the reactor’s operating point. Therefore it is a <strong>graphical</strong> solution to the design equation and the energy balance for the CSTR.</p>

<p>For reasons of convenience, several different expressions for heat production and heat removal are used. For the heat production with constant density reactions, we have:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the heat production per unit time: <span class="math inline">\(\left(-\Delta H_r\right) \upsilon C_{A0} X_A\)</span></li>
<li>the heat production per unit of volume of reaction mixture: <span class="math inline">\(\left(-\Delta H_r\right) C_{A0} X_A\)</span></li>
<li>the heat production per unit of volume of reaction mixture divided by <span class="math inline">\(\rho C_P\)</span>, the sensible heat per unit of volume of the reaction: <span class="math inline">\(\left(-\Delta H_r\right) C_{A0} X_A/\rho C_P\)</span>. This represents the fraction of the maximum possible temperature increase, which is reached in the reactor.</li>
</ol>
<p>For heat removal, similar expressions can be defined. As long as the HPR and HWR are unit-consistent, all will lead to the same conclusions concerning the reactor design and operation. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-westerterp1984" role="doc-biblioref">Westertep, Van Swaaij, and Beenackers 1984</a>)</span></p>

<div id="multiple-steady-states-analysis" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Multiple steady-states analysis</h4>
<p>Another essential aspect of CSRT design is to determine if multiple steady-states are raised. This situation is possible because a non-linear equation can have more than one solution. Nevertheless, how is it possible to determine this particular situation?</p>
<p>Let us consider some changes to the situation shown in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003005aaa">2.11</a>. Suppose that the temperature of the feed, <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>, or the cooling fluid temperature, <em>Tc</em>, is reduced. The result of this modification will be to increase the intercept of the HWR(T) line on the y-axis without changing the slope of the line. It means that HWR(T) line shifts to the left, parallel to the original curve, so that it could be more than one operating point. This situation is known as <strong>multiple steady-states</strong></p>
<p>In order to determine if there are multiple steady-states for a CSTR. We are going to follow the next steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Let us fixed inlet conditions.</li>
<li>Let us establish a range for <em>T</em> we are interested in.</li>
<li>For each <em>T</em> in the temperature range, let calculate <em>k</em> and <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(C_A\)</span>).</li>
<li>Again, for each <em>T</em>, the cooling fluid temperature <em>Tc</em> is calculated.</li>
<li>Finally, the set of values for <em>T</em>, <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span>, and <em>Tc</em> is substituted into the reactor energy balance.
When the left-hand side of equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003020a">(2.28)</a> is equal to 0, a steady-state will have been reached.</li>
</ol>
<p>The heat-transfer fluid consumption is calculated from an energy balance around the perfectly mixed jacket at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_J\)</span>. Constant physical properties of the cooling medium are assumed.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ec003024">\[\begin{equation}
    F_c\,\rho_c\,C_{P_c} T_{c,\text{in}} = F_c\,\rho_c\,C_{P_c} T_J - Q
    \tag{2.32}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(F_c\)</span> is flow rate of coolant <span class="math inline">\(\left(\text{m}^{3}/\text{s}\right)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{c}\)</span> means density of coolant <span class="math inline">\(\left(\text{kg}/\text{m}^{3}\right)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C_{P_c}\)</span> is heat capacity of coolant <span class="math inline">\(\left(\text{J}\,\text{kg}^{-1}\,\text{K}^{-1}\right)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T_{c,\text{in}}\)</span> represents the supply temperature of cooling medium (K), and <span class="math inline">\(T_{J}\)</span> is the output temperature of cooling medium (K).</p>
<p>The typical reactor design situation is given the feed conditions, the kinetic information, and the desired conversion. The problem is to determine the temperature and the size of the reactor.

<p>When we are dealing with exothermic reactions, several steady states may be possible in a CSTR, which can easily calculate them if we rewrite the equations like so:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
C_A &amp;= \frac{F_0\,C_{A0}}{F+V\,k} \\
T_J &amp;= \frac{\rho_J\,C_{P_J}F_J\,T_{J_0} + U\,A_J\,T}{\rho_J\,C_{P_J}\,F_J+ U\,A_J}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Now, these equations are solved for a range <span class="math inline">\(500 \leq T \leq 700\)</span>, next their results are evaluated into energy balance function (eq. @ref{eq:ec003020b}) on the reactor.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ec003020b">\[\begin{equation}

\end{equation}\]</span></p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a> shows the system has three operating-points. Now, how a CSTR can operate at multiple steady-states is necessary to know which is (or which of them) stable for the operating condition.
Thus, the next step in designing a non-isothermal CSTR must be to carry out a steady-state analysis.</p>
<p>Usually, the stability analysis can be done from the plot <em>HPR(T)</em>-<em>HWR(T)</em> vs. reaction temperature.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.13: Graphical solutions of the heat balance for a CSTR
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003008">2.13</a> shows <em>HPR</em> is a sigmoidal curve because of the rate constant’s exponential temperature dependence. The shape of the curve depends in large part on the value of the activation energy.</p>
<p>All possible reactor operating temperatures must satisfy both functions, <em>HPR</em> and <em>HWR</em>, such that the two functions have equal values. These operating points are represented in Fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003008">2.13</a> by circles.</p>
<p>Additionally, Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003008">2.13</a> shows that the <em>HWR</em> line intercepts the <em>HPR</em> curve in three points at the same temperatures shown in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a>.
Gray dots represent stable conditions, and especially the latter point is of practical interest since it represents a high degree of conversion.</p>
<p>The stable conditions are related to the fact that the heat removal line’s slope should be greater than that of the heat production line. Under that condition, more heat is removed on a positive deviation from the operating point than produced heat so that the reaction temperature will return to the steady-state value.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003008">2.13</a>’s black circle is an unstable operating condition because the situation is reversed than for gray dots. Since the heat production curve slope is here more significant than that of the heat removal line, any positive temperature deviation will be amplified until the reactor works in the upper stable operating point and vice versa.</p>
<p>In summary, the lower stable steady-state operating point in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a> corresponds to low rates of heat generation and removal. This combination may result from one or more of the following factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Small values of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_R\)</span>;</li>
<li>Low value of the reaction rate constant;</li>
<li>Short average residence time;</li>
<li>Small value of the feed rate, and</li>
<li>Fast removal of heat from the reactor, which does not cause the temperature to rise to higher values.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, the higher stable steady-state operating point in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a> corresponds to the reactant’s nearly complete consumption. This outcome is favored by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>An enormous value of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_R\)</span>;</li>
<li>A more considerable value of the reaction rate constant;</li>
<li>Longer average residence time;</li>
<li>Larger reactant throughput, and</li>
<li>A slower heat removal regime by a heat exchanger.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether the reactor operates at a lower or higher stable point depends on how it is started up. The <strong>unsteady energy</strong> and material balances must be solved simultaneously to determine the effect of startup conditions.</p>
<p>The type of stability analysis carried out above is not mathematically rigorous. However, it is a handy way to understand the concept of stable and unstable operating points. In mathematical terms, the above analysis has shown that a steady-state operating will be unstable if
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \left[\frac{\partial HPR(T)}{\partial T}\right]_\text{operating point} &gt; \left[\frac{\partial HWR(T)}{\partial T}\right]_\text{operating point}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>and will be stable if
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \left[\frac{\partial HPR(T)}{\partial T}\right]_\text{operating point} &lt; \left[\frac{\partial HWR(T)}{\partial T}\right]_\text{operating point}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>The first inequality is a sufficient criterion for instability so that the operating point will be intrinsically unstable in this situation. The second inequality is a sufficient criterion for stability, provided that the CSTR is adiabatic. If the reactor is not adiabatic, the second condition is necessary but not sufficient.</p>
<p>It is important to remark that the curve HPR/HRW vs. <em>T</em> performed in Fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a> corresponds to a simple reaction rate expression <span class="math inline">\(r_A = - k\,C_A\)</span>.
As the reaction change’s characteristics, the shape of that curve will change, and the resulting analysis will need to be accordingly modified.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003009">2.14</a> presents qualitative forms of the HPW/HWR curve for (a) a reversible reaction, (b) a pair of consecutive exothermic reactions, and (c) for two consecutive reactions, where the first is exothermic and the second is endothermic.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Plug-flow reactor (PFR)</h2>
<p>Plug flow is a simplified and idealized picture of a fluid’s motion, whereby all the fluid elements move with a uniform velocity along parallel streamlines. This perfectly ordered flow is the only transport mechanism accounted for in the plug flow reactor model.</p>
<p>In summary, the essential features of a PFR are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The volumetric flow may vary continuously in the direction of the flow because of a change in density,</li>
<li>Each element of fluid is a closed system; that is, there is no axial mixing (it seems a CSTR),</li>
<li>fluid properties may change continuously in the axial direction but are constant radially at a given axial position,</li>
<li>Each element of fluid has the same residence time, t, as any other.</li>
</ol>
<p>This kind of reactor is usually used:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When a high flow rate of the reacting system is needed (fast reactions).</li>
<li>Large scale.</li>
<li>High temperature.</li>
<li>Homogeneous or heterogeneous reactions.</li>
<li>Continuous operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a PFR, the composition of the fluid varies from point to point along a flow path. Thus the material balance for a reaction component must be made for a differential element dV, as shown in Figure X.</p>

<p>The shape of figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig002017">2.16</a> is based on the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(-r_A\)</span> decreases as <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> increases. Thus equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002051">(2.39)</a> states that <span class="math inline">\((V/F_{A0})\)</span> for an ideal PFR is the area under the curve of <span class="math inline">\((1/-r_A)\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span>, between the inlet and outlet fractional conversion.</p>

<h4>Variable-Density System</h4>
<p>When the reacting system’s density is not constant throughout a PFR, the size of a PFR must be calculated using the general design equation (Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002051">(2.39)</a>).</p>
<p>For example for an irreversible first-order reaction, which <span class="math inline">\(r_A = - k\,C_A\)</span>. The kinetic equation will be written as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  r_A = - k\,C_A = -k\,\frac{F_A}{\upsilon} = - k\,F_{A0}\:\frac{\left(1-X_A\right)}{\upsilon}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the equation design is
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002054a">\[\begin{equation}
\tau = - C_{A0} \int_0^{X_A} \frac{d\,X_A}{r_A} = C_{A0} \int_0^{X_A} \frac{\upsilon\:d\,X_A}{k\:F_{A0}\:\left(1-X_A\right)} = \frac{1}{k\:\upsilon_0} \int_0^{X_A} \frac{\upsilon\:d\,X_A}{1-X_A}
\tag{2.42}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Taking into account that, in this case, <span class="math inline">\(\upsilon = \upsilon_0 \left(1 + \varepsilon_A\,X_A\right)\)</span> then <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002054a">(2.42)</a> becomes
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002054">\[\begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{1}{k} \int_0^{X_A} \frac{\left(1 + \varepsilon_A X_A\right)}{1-X_A}\:dX_A
  \tag{2.40}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>As it was mentioned before, for ideal PFR, all fluid elements take the same length of time in the reactor. This time is called <strong>mean residence time</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\overline t\)</span>) and, in general, it could be calculated by:
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002056">\[\begin{equation}
    \overline{t} = \int_{0}^{V} \frac{dV}{\upsilon}
    \tag{2.43}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\upsilon\)</span> is the volumetric flow rate.</p>
<p>The space-time and the mean residence time are identical when there is no density change in the reactor.
For analyzing kinetic data obtained from tubular reactors, the <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is a more useful variable than <em>t</em> because the former is an independent variable. In contrast, the latter only can be obtained if the progressive changes occurring within the reactor are known beforehand.</p>
<div class="infobox info">
<p>For systems of constant density, the performance equations are identical for a BR and PFR, which means <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> for PFR is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for the BR</p>

Figure 2.17: PFR reactor volume element

</div>
<p>According to Fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003009a">2.17</a>, the steady-state energy balance over a differential volume of the reactor becomes, if any work done by the reaction mixture is neglected:

\tag{2.45}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The enthalpy term can be broken apart into two terms:
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003028">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{dQ}{dV} - \sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} \left(\frac{dF_{i}}{dV} \, H_i\right) -\sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} \left(F_i \, \frac{dH_{i}}{dV} \right)= 0

<p>The second term in Fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003027">(2.45)</a> is related to a molar balance over specie <em>i</em>. If we consider that only one reaction is taking place in the PFR:

This equation is equivalent to:

<p>Equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003028e">(2.51)</a> provided the concentration and temperature profiles in the PFR as a function of <em>V</em>, solving it simultaneously with Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003028c">(2.49)</a>, when the rate of heat transfer to the reactor is known.</p>
<p>In most cases, the equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003028e">(2.51)</a> is written in terms of 1 mole of the key reactant A.

<h4>Temperature and concentration profiles as function of PFR length</h4>
<p>In case that the tube diameter is constant, it could be useful to express Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003028e">(2.51)</a> considering the differential element of length (<em>dL</em>() rather than the differential element of volume, <em>dV</em>.</p>
<p>The volume of the reactor is related to the axial length, <em>L</em>, and the vessel diameter, <em>D</em>. Thus, over a differential element of volume:

<p>Substituting this relationship into Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003028c">(2.49)</a>, the molar-balance equation then becomes for <em>A</em>
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003028i">\[\begin{equation}

where <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the linear velocity with which the fluid flows through the tube, and <span class="math inline">\(C_i\)</span> is the concentration of the specie <em>i</em>.</p>

<div id="external-heat-transfer-to-pfr" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>External Heat Transfer to PFR</h4>
<p>In such cases, when a PFR operates with heat transfer to the surroundings to control the temperature within a specified range, it is possible to impose a constant heat flux at the reactor’s wall, which could be implemented example, electrical heating.</p>
<p>The rate of heat transfer depends on the local temperature difference between the fluid in the reactor and the heat transfer fluid, as follow:
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003028k">\[\begin{equation}
  \frac{dQ}{dV} = U \left( T_{\infty} - T\right) \frac{dA}{dV}
  \tag{2.58}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where: U is overall heat transfer coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(T_{\infty}\)</span> is the temperature of the surrounding heat transfer fluid, <em>T</em> is the temperature inside of the reactor, <em>A</em> is the heat transfer area of the reactor upon which <em>U</em> is based.</p>
<p><em>A</em> represents the heat transfer area of the external wall of the tube, thus.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  d\,A = p_w \, dL
\end{equation}\]</span>
<span class="math inline">\(p_w\)</span> is the perimeter length of the tube wall. Suppose the tube is cylindrical, then <span class="math inline">\(A = \pi\,D\)</span>.
Thus, for a typical PFR illustrated in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003009a">2.17</a>, with a length equals to <em>dL</em>
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003029">\[\begin{equation}
  \frac{dQ}{dV} = U \left( T_{\infty} - T\right) \frac{\pi\,D\,dL}{\left(\pi D^2/4\right)dL} = U \left( T_{\infty} - T\right) \frac{4}{D}
  \tag{2.59}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003029">(2.59)</a> into Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003028d">(2.50)</a>

\tag{2.60}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>This equation is one form of the energy balance for a PFR with external heat exchange. It is widespread to rewrite the energy balance as
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003031">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dV} = \frac{1}{{\sum_{i=1}^\mathcal{C}} F_{i} \,C_{P_i}}\left({\frac{4U\left(T_{\infty}-T\right)}{D} + \Delta H_{R,A}\,r_A}\right)

<p>Writing Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003031">(2.61)</a> in terms of the length by substituting Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003028f">(2.52)</a>

\tag{2.62}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Any form of energy balance equation must be combined with the molar balance over PFR to obtain the temperature and concentration profiles along the reactor. In cases in which pressure could not be neglected, the momentum balance must be added.</p>
<p>One standard method of reactor operation is having a phase change taking place in the heat transfer fluid, that is, a boiling or condensing fluid use. In this operating mode, <span class="math inline">\(T_\infty\)</span> is constant, and the energy balance equation is solving based on that supposition.</p>
<p>Another useful assumption is considering an average heat capacity value (composition independent) which gives the following equation.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dL} = \frac{\pi\,U\,D}{\dot{m}\,\overline{C}_P}\left(T_{\infty}-T\right) + \frac{\pi\,D^2}{4 \dot{m}\,\overline{C}_P}\Delta H_{R,A}\,r_A
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>From temperature analysis, there are four essential differences between PFRs and CSTRs.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The variation properties with axial position down the length of the reactor. In CSTR, the maximum reaction temperature is reached at the exit of the reactor under steady-state conditions.
However, in a PFR, the peak temperature usually occurs at an intermediate axial position in the reactor. (assuming irreversible and exothermic reaction).</li>
<li>In a CSTR, a change over an input variable has an immediate effect on variables inside the reactor. In contrast, a PFR takes time for the disturbance to work its way through the reactor to exit. Thus there are significant dynamic lags and dead time between changes made at the inlet of the reactor and temperatures and compositions further down the reactor’s length.</li>
<li>It is mechanically impossible to control the reaction temperature at each axial position down the PFR. Only a single temperature can be controlled, which can be the peak temperature or exit temperature.</li>
<li>In CSTR, the inlet temperature is not the most critical process variable but, in the case of a PFR, it is a design and control variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The primary assumption about flow pattern in a PFR is relatively reasonable for an adiabatic reactor.
However, for non-adiabatic reactors, radial temperature gradients are inherent features.
However, if tube diameters are kept small, the plug flow assumption is more suitable.</p>

<p>A recycling reactor is an ideal tubular reactor that part of the effluent stream back to the reactor inlet. As shown in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig002021">2.18</a>. Recycle can control the temperature in the reactor and adjust the product distribution if more than one reaction is taking place.</p>

Figure 2.18: Recycle PFR
</p>
</div>
<p>Based on the flowsheet in Fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig002021">2.18</a>, the feed to the process is denoted by the subscript ‘’o’’ with is mixed at the point M with the recycle stream, denoted by a subscript ‘’R’‘. The mixed stream, which is denoted by a subscript’‘in’’, is then fed to the reactor.</p>
<p>At point S, the outlet stream from the reactor, which is denoted by a subscript ‘’out’‘, is split into recycle stream and the final stream leaving the process (denoted by a subscript’‘f’’). The recycle ratio, <em>R</em>, as defined as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
R = \frac{\upsilon_R}{\upsilon_f} = \frac{F_{\text{tot},R}}{F_{\text{tot},f}} = \frac{F_{A,R}}{F_{A,f}} 
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\upsilon\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are the volumetric and molar flow, respectively.</p>
<p>If the fresh feed <span class="math inline">\(F_o\)</span> contains a molar fraction <span class="math inline">\(x_{Ao}\)</span>, and the reactor product a molar fraction <span class="math inline">\(x_{A}\)</span> of the specie <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then the molar balance for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at point <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
F_{A,in} = F_{A,0} + F_{A,R} = F_{A,0} + R \, F_{A,f}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> balance at point S is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
F_{A,out} = F_{A,f} + F_{A,R} = F_{A,f} + R \, F_{A,f} = \left(1 + R \right) F_{A,f} \Rightarrow F_{A,f} = \frac{F_{A,out}}{1 + R}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>Combining those last two equations, the desired expression for the initial value of the molar flow rate of A will be:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
F_{A,in} = F_{A,0} + R\,\frac{F_{A,out}}{1 + R}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>The material balance may obtain the volume of the recycled PFR for the reactant <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> into the reactor, which is
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq064">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{V }{F_\text{in}} = - \int_{X_{A,\text{in}} }^{X_A} {\frac{dX_A }{r_A }}
\tag{2.63}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>However, there are at least two ways to define the conversion of a system like this. One is the per-pass conversion given in eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ecconglobal">(2.65)</a> and the other is the overall conversion given in equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ecconglobal">(2.65)</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ecconglobal" id="eq:ecconpass">\[\begin{gather}
X_{A,pass} = \frac{F_{A,in} - F_{A,out}}{F_{A,in}} \tag{2.64} \\ 
X_{A,overall} = \frac{F_{A,0} - F_{A,f}}{F_{A,0}} \tag{2.65} 
\end{gather}\]</span></p>
<p>It is essential to consider that the reactor’s volumetric flow rate is greater than the volumetric flow rate entering the process when the rate expression contains concentrations.</p>
<p>The definition of concentration (eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eccondef">(2.66)</a>) is used as usual. For a gas-phase system, the volumetric flow rate, in the denominator, is written using an appropriate equation of state.
<span class="math display" id="eq:eccondef">\[\begin{equation}
  C_i = \frac{F_i}{\upsilon}
  \tag{2.66}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, if the fluid is a liquid of constant density, the reactor’s volumetric flow rate must be used according to Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ecconcliquid">(2.67)</a>
<span class="math display" id="eq:ecconcliquid">\[\begin{equation}
  C_i  =\frac{F_i}{\upsilon_{in}}  = \frac{F_i}{\upsilon_{0}\left(1 + R\right)}
  \tag{2.67}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>When the recycled PFR operates at non-isothermal temperature, the initial condition for the temperature is found at point M while noting that <span class="math inline">\(T_{out} = T_R = T_f\)</span>. Assuming that no phase change occurs in any of the streams, the heat balance would be:
<span class="math display" id="eq:echeatbalanceM">\[\begin{equation}
  \sum_i \left(F_{i,0} \int_{T_0}^{T_{in}} C_{P,i} dT \right) +  \sum_i \left(F_{i,R} \int_{T_R}^{T_{in}} C_{P,i} dT \right) = 0
  \tag{2.68}
\end{equation}\]</span>
Therefore, the temperature of the stream ‘’in’’
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  T_{in} = T_0\,\frac{\sum_i \left(F_{i,0}  C_{P,i} \right) + T_R\, \sum_i \left(F_{i,R} C_{P,i}\right)}{\sum_i \left(F_{i,in}  C_{P,i} \right) }
  (\#eq:ectemp_in)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In summary, the performance of a non-isothermal recycle PFR must be calculate
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  &amp;\frac{dF_i}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum \nu_{i,j} r_j \\
  &amp; \pi D U \left(T_e - T\right) = \left(\sum F_i C_{P,i}\right)\frac{dT}{dz} + \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \sum r_j \Delta H_j \\
  &amp; F_i \left(z =0\right) = F_{i,in} = F_{i,0} + \frac{R}{1+R} F_{i,out} \\
  &amp; T \left(z=0\right) = T_{in}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>This EDO system must be solved using successive substitution because the flow rate and temperature of stream ``in’’ usually are not provided. To calculate the initial values of these variables is necessary to know the molar flow rate and temperature of the stream ‘’out’’. However, <span class="math inline">\(F_{i,in}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{in}\)</span> are needed to integrate the design equation and calculate <span class="math inline">\(F_{i,out}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{out}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The problem could be solved by calculating an initial guess for the conditions of stream ``in’’ assuming that there is no recycle stream. The previous calculation provides an educated-guess for the composition and temperature of the recycle stream ‘’R’’. The rest of the calculations are performed using these values as initial conditions.</p>
<p>Under isothermal operation and assuming that <span class="math inline">\(F_0 = F_f\)</span>, and noting that <span class="math inline">\(x_{A,R} = x_{A,out} = x_{A,f}\)</span>, the problem is much easier to solve. A balance for <em>A</em> at point M.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  F_0\,x_{A,0} + F_R\,x_{A,R}  = F_\text{in}\,x_{A,in}
\end{equation*}\]</span>
Now, a balance on the reactor
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  F_\text{in} = F_{out} = F_f \left(1 + R\right) \equiv F_0 \left(1 + R\right) 
\end{equation*}\]</span>
Therefore
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
      x_{A,\text{in}} &amp;= \frac{F_0\,x_{A,0} + F_R \,x_{A,f}}{F_\text{in}} \\
                &amp; = \frac{F_0\,x_{A,0} + F_0\,R\,x_{A,f}}{F_{out}} = \frac{F_0\left( x_{A,0} + R\,x_{A,f}\right)}{F_0 \left(1 + R\right) } 
\end{align*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(x_{A,k}\)</span> referred to molar fraction of A in the stream <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span></p>
<p>Then, the total reactor feed contains a molar fraction <span class="math inline">\(x_{A,\text{in}}\)</span>, given by
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq063">\[\begin{equation}
        x_{A,\text{in}} = \frac{x_{Ao} + R\,x_{A}}{1+R} 
        \tag{2.69}
    \end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The fractional conversion in the stream entering the reactor <span class="math inline">\(X_{A,\text{in}}\)</span> is not zero since this stream is a combination of fresh feed and the recycle stream. Thus the fractional conversion at the reactor inlet is:
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq065">\[\begin{align}
    X_{A,\text{in}} =&amp; \frac{x_{Ao} - x_{A,\text{in}}}{x_{Ao}}  \notag \\
    &amp; = \frac{1}{x_{Ao}} \left( x_{Ao}  - \frac{x_{Ao} + R\,x_{A}}{1+R}\right) \notag \\
    X_{A,\text{in}} &amp; = \frac{R}{1 + R} X_A
    \tag{2.70}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq065">(2.70)</a> in <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq064">(2.63)</a>
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq066">\[\begin{equation}
    V= - F_0 \left( 1 + R \right)\int_{ \frac{R}{1 + R} X_A}^{X_A} {\frac{dX_A }{r_A }}
    \tag{2.71}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In this case, <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> represents the overall conversion which means
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  X_A = \frac{\text{moles of A reacted overall}}{\text{mole of fresh feed}}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>For the particular case where density changes are negligible, we may write <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq066">(2.71)</a> in terms of concentrations,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \tau = \left( 1 + R \right)\int_{ \frac{C_{A0} + R\,C_{Af}}{1 + R}}^{C_{Af}} {\frac{dC_A }{r_A }}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq066">(2.71)</a> is the mole balance for a recycled reactor, which has two characteristic limiting cases:</p>

<p>It could be interesting to know the <strong>per pass conversion of <em>A</em></strong>, which is the fraction of the total feed of reactant A converted in a single pass through the reactor.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  X_A = \frac{\text{moles of A reacted in a single pass}}{\text{mole of of A feed to the reactor}}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>In this case, the total molar flow rate of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> into the reactor is <span class="math inline">\(F_o + R\,F_{out}\)</span>, and to set the fractional inlet conversion of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, equal to zero for the combined stream that enters the reactor. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-roberts2009" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts 2009</a>)</span></p>
<p>On this basis, the design equation becomes
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \frac{V}{F_o + R\,F_{out}} = - \int_0^{X_A} \frac{dX}{r_A}
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  X_A = &amp; \frac{\left(F_o + R\,F_{out}\right) - \left(R+1\right)F_{out}}{F_o + R\,F_{out}} = \frac{F_o - F_{out}}{F_o + R\,F_{out}} \\
  X_A = &amp; \frac{F_o - F_o\left(1 - X_A\right)}{F_o + R\,F_o\left(1 - X_A\right)} = \frac{X_A}{1 + R\left(1 - X_A\right)}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>This equation is difficult to solve because <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> appears on both sides of it. Therefore, the previous method is much simpler. The following example may serve to illustrate this reactor type.</p>
