<p>Process design has to do with specific matters relating to the process itself, in our cases, such as operation conditions, size, configuration, and operation mode of the reactor.</p>

</div>
<p>In this course, we will focus on the phenomena taking place in basic reactor types.</p>
<p>The phenomena occurring in a reactor may be broken down into reaction, mass, heat, and momentum transfer. Therefore, reactors’ modeling and design are based on the reaction rate equation, the continuity, energy, and momentum equations. The modeling and design of reactors are based on the equations describing these phenomena: the reaction rate equation and the continuity, energy, and momentum equations <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-froment2011" role="doc-biblioref">Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will study two situations (1) the design of a new chemical reactor for a new process, (2) the analysis of the performance of an existing reactor for a current process. In many cases, as chemical engineers, we must consider several items shown in figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:mindmap">2.1</a> when starts the design or analysis of a reactor.</p>

<div id="material-balance" class="section level3" number="2.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Material Balance</h3>
<p>As a chemical engineer, our main modeling tools are the material balance and energy balance. We should remember two aspects: the material balance of a reactor must consider the rate at which species are converted from one chemical form to another and the rate at which energy is transformed by the process.</p>
<p>We will perform a mole balance on species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in a system volume, where <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> represents the particular chemical species of interest.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.2: System volume scheme
</p>
</div>
<p>Based on figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:arbitrarysystem">2.2</a>, the mole balance expressed in mole/time would be</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:continuidad">\[\begin{equation}
 F_{j0}  +  G_j   - {F_j } =  \frac{dN_j}{dt}
\tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(F_{j0}\)</span> is rate flow in <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(G_j\)</span> is the generation rate of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> by chemical reaction, <span class="math inline">\(F_{j}\)</span> is rate flow out <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(dN_j/dt\)</span> means accumulation rate of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>In equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:continuidad">(2.1)</a>, the generation/consumption of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(G_j\)</span>) will be expressed as the product of the reaction volume, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, and the rate of reaction, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>The symbol <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is expressed in molar units per unit time and volume, and it is always <strong>positive</strong> when the reaction proceeds in the direction of the arrow. Thus, the integral form of the general mole balance for any chemical specie <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> yields.
<span class="math display" id="eq:genbal">\[\begin{equation}
  F_{j0} - F_j + \int_{0}^V {r_j\,dV} = \frac{dN_j}{dt}
  \tag{2.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In mathematical terms, the equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:genbal">(2.2)</a> is called the continuity equation for <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> reacts in more than one phase, such an equation is needed for each phase. This equation will develop the design equations for different ideal reactors: batch, semi-batch, and continuous-flow.</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> can enter or leave the volume element are flow and molecular diffusion, and they are irrelevant. However, it is essential to realize that a fluid’s motion is not really ordered and challenging to describe.</p>
<p>For this reason, as a first approach, it is therefore natural to consider two extreme conceptual cases: first, where there is no mixing of the streamlines, and second, where the mixing is complete. These two extremes may be formulated with sufficient approximation by the tubular plug flow reactor, and the continuous flow stirred tank with complete mixing.</p>
<p>In a plug flow reactor, all fluids elements move with equal velocity along parallel streamlines. The plug flow is the only mechanism for mass transport, and there is no mixing between fluid elements. The reaction leads to a concentration gradient in the axial flow direction.</p>
<p>Reactors with complete mixing may be subdivided into batch and continuous types. In batch-reactor types with complete mixing, the composition is uniform throughout the reactor. Consequently, the continuity equations may be written for the entire contents, not over a volume element. As the bulk composition varies with time, a first-order ordinary differential equation is obtained, with time as a variable. The form of this equation is analogous to that for the plug flow case.</p>
<p>In the continuous flow type, an element of the entering fluid is instantaneously mixed with the reactor’s contents so that it loses its identity. This type also operates at a constant concentration level. In the steady-state, the continuity equations are algebraic.</p>
<p>Both types of continuous reactors considered are idealized conceptual cases. They are important cases because they are easy to calculate and give the extreme values of the conversions between those realized in a real reactor. With its intermediate level of mixing, the design of a real reactor requires information about this mixing.<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-froment2011" role="doc-biblioref">Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011</a>)</span></p>

<div id="energy-balance" class="section level3" number="2.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Energy Balance</h3>
<p>The real chemical reactors are almost operated under nonisothermal conditions because reactions generate or absorb large amounts of heat. Detailed reactor sizing and analysis require the energy balance to be solved in conjunction with one or more material balances.</p>
<p>For a generic open system, the energy balance is:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
 Q -  {W_s} + \dot{H}_\text{in} - \dot{H}_\text{out}  =  \frac{dE}{dt}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>The terms in energy balances have the following meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the rate of heat transfer <strong>into</strong> the reactor.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(W_s\)</span> means the rate at which shaft work is done by the system on the surrounding. If shaft work is done on the contents of the reactor, e.g., by an agitator, the value of <span class="math inline">\(W_s\)</span> is negative.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\dot{H}_\text{in}\)</span> is the rate at which enthalpy is transported into the reactor.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\dot{H}_\text{out}\)</span> is the rate at which enthalpy is transported out of the reactor.</li>

<p>The form of the energy balance results from considerations closely related to those for different continuity equations. When the mixing is so intense that the concentration is uniform over the reactor, it may be accepted that the temperature is also uniform.</p>
<p>When plug flow is postulated, it is natural to accept that the concentration in a section perpendicular to flow is considered to be uniform. It is natural to also consider the temperature to be uniform in this section. It follows that when the heat is exchanged with the surroundings, the temperature gradient has to be situated entirely in a thin “film” along the wall. This also implies that the resistance to heat transfer in the central core is zero in a direction perpendicular to the flow, which is not right for certain catalytic reactors.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The Continuous-Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR)</h2>
<p>When the demand for a single chemical product reaches a high level, there will be an economic incentive to continuously manufacture it, using a reactor dedicated to that product. One of those is The <em>Continuous-Stirred-Tank Reactor or CSTR</em>.</p>
<p><img src="ebook_notes_5314_files/figure-html/cstrdraw-1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The CSTR is a well-mixed vessel consisting of a baffled tank with mixing induced by an impeller and operates at a steady-state. The mass flow rate into the tank is equal to the mass flow rate out of it at steady-state, and the feed and product properties are not functions of time. Furthermore, the reactor volume is constant.</p>
<p>A well-mixed vessel means a working fluid with neither radial, axial, nor angular gradients in properties. In other words, both the composition and temperature of the fluid are uniform over the entire volume. That is, they do not vary with position. Those assumptions are</p>
<p>The central assumption is that the incoming fluid concentration will become instantaneously equal to outgoing upon entering the vessel. As a consequence of well-mixing behavior, the effluent stream must have precisely the same composition and temperature as the contents of the reactor. The feed must be immediately mixed with the reactor’s contents in a time interval that is very small compared to the mean residence time of the fluid flowing through the vessel to meet this ideal mixing pattern. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-froment2011" role="doc-biblioref">Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011</a>)</span></p>
<p>The CSTR is frequently chosen when temperature control is a critical aspect when the conversion must occur at constant composition, when a reaction between two phases has to be carried out, or when a catalyst must be kept in suspension. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-froment2011" role="doc-biblioref">Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011</a>)</span></p>

<p>At steady-state, the left-hand side of eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq002028a">(2.6)</a> is zero, thus

where <span class="math inline">\(C_{0,j}\)</span> is the concentration of specie <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> at initial conditions, <span class="math inline">\(C_j\)</span> is the concentration into the reactor, and <span class="math inline">\(\overline t\)</span> is used to refer to the <strong>mean residence time</strong>, which is given by

where <span class="math inline">\(\upsilon_0\)</span> is the volumetric flow rate evaluated at entrance conditions, and <span class="math inline">\(\nu = \sum\nolimits_j \nu_j\)</span></p>
<p>Since the volumetric flow rate is a function of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, the mean residence time, <span class="math inline">\(\overline t\)</span>, depends on those variables. Instead of using the reactor residence time to describe performance, an equal quantity called <strong>space-time</strong> define as:

    \tau = \frac{V}{\upsilon_0}
    \tag{2.12}

This definition of space-time applies to any continuous reactor.</p>
<p>For a homogeneous reaction, space-time has the dimension of time. It is related to the average time a volume element of fluid spends in the reactor.</p>
<p>Although space-time is not necessarily equal to the mean residence time, they behave similarly, and it is possible to relate eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq002032">(2.10)</a> and eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq002033">(2.12)</a>

<p>If the volume change in the reactor is negligible, then <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_A = 0\)</span>. Finally, if the working fluid has constant density

<p>Space-time influences reaction behavior in a continuous reactor in the same way that real-time does on a batch reactor’s behavior. In both cases, the fractional conversion will increase if reactants spend more time or space-time increases.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the fluid density is constant, eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq002031">(2.8)</a> becomes

<p>Assuming all reactors have the same volume (<span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span>), which means they have the same <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, then the total residence time in the series of <em>N</em> equal-residence-time CSTR is equal <span class="math inline">\(\sum\nolimits_{k} \tau_{k} = N\, \tau\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_{A,N}\)</span>, the concentration from the <em>N</em>-th reactor is given in terms of <span class="math inline">\(C_{A0}\)</span> by:</p>

<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig002014">2.5</a> shows the variation of conversion vs. the number of reactors in series for a first-order reaction.

<p>In general, while the Damkholer number increases, the system will require fewer CSTRs to get the desired level of conversion. <a href="https://github.com/aliglara/ebook_che5314_ucv/blob/main/codes/lect_004CSTRSeries.ipynb">(Numerical solution)</a></p>
<p>The total capital cost is an important parameter rather than the total reactor volume in a practical situation. Increasing the number of CSTRs in series will reduce the total cost by reducing the required volume. However, it will also increase the price since more agitators, valves, piping, etc., will be required. The economic optimum usually occurs at a value of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> as low as 2 or 3. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-roberts2009" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts 2009</a>)</span></p>

<p>The optimal operation of a multistage CSTR can be considered from the point of view of minimizing the total volume V for a given throughput (<span class="math inline">\(F_{A0}\)</span>) and fractional conversion (<span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span>).

<p>Another interesting situation is finding the best setup to achieve a given conversion. Let us illustrate the use of this method considering two CSTRs in series under isothermal conditions, as shown in the Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:CSTRseriesdifV">2.7</a></p>

<p>For the first CSTR, the design equation becomes
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

<p>These relations are graphically represented in the Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:CSTRseriesdifV2">2.8</a>. The cascade of CSTRs operates between known initial and final conversion levels, and the total reaction volume is represented by the sum of the shaded areas.</p>

<p>When the rectangle <em>KLMN</em> is made as large as possible, the overall volume is minimized. Therefore, point <span class="math inline">\(X_{A1}\)</span> is the critical parameter to get the reactors’ optimal size.</p>
<p>For reaction rate expressions of the _n_th-order form, it can be shown that there is always one and only one point that minimizes the total volume when <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;0\)</span>. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-hill2014" role="doc-biblioref">Hill and Root 2014</a>)</span></p>
<p>The total reaction volume is:
<span class="math display" id="eq:totalVolume">\[\begin{equation}
V_1 + V_2 = F_{A0}\:\frac{X_{A1}}{(-r_A)_1} + F_{A0}\:\frac{X_{A2} - X_{A1}}{(-r_A)_2}

\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The derivative of eq. #ref(eq:totalVolume) respects to <span class="math inline">\(X_{A1}\)</span> is:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

simplifying leads to

<p>Therefore, the minimum reaction volume will be found when the intermediate fractional conversion <span class="math inline">\(X_{A1}\)</span> is selected.

<p>Now let us find out how to apply the general energy balance (eq.<a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:energybal">(2.3)</a>) to a CSTR. Usually, for an ideal CSTR operating at a steady-state (<span class="math inline">\(dU/dt = 0\)</span>), it is considered the work done by the stirrer neglected, so the energy balance yields to:</p>

<p>Using the energy balance to analyze the performance or sizing an ideal CSTR is not as complicated mathematically, so let us consider some typical heat transfer modes.</p>
<div id="jacket-cooled" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Jacket-Cooled</h4>
<p>Consider the ideal CSTR shown in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003005a">2.10</a>. Heat is added to or removed from the reactor by a heat-transfer fluid that flows through the jacket.
Depending on the reactor temperature and whether the reactor is being heated or cooled, the heat-transfer fluid may be cooling water, chilled brine, chilled glycol solution, hot oil, or some other fluid. The fluid is a source of (or a sink for) the heat transferred through the reactor wall.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:fig003005a"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.10: Schematic diagram of an ideal CSTR with heat transfer through a heating/cooling jacket
</p>
</div>
<p>The transit energy rate is <span class="math inline">\(\dot{W}\)</span>. The temperature of the fluid at a point in the jacket is <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>. The fluid enters the jacket at <span class="math inline">\(T_{c,i}\)</span> and leaves at <span class="math inline">\(T_{c,o}\)</span>. The feed enters the reactor at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>. The molar flow rates of each component of the feed are designated <span class="math inline">\(F_{i,0}\)</span>, and its corresponding concentrations are designated <span class="math inline">\(C_{i,0}\)</span>. The reactor operates at a temperature, <em>T</em>, which is the effluent temperature too. The molar flow rates in the output stream are designated <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span>, and the corresponding concentrations are <span class="math inline">\(C_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>If a single reaction occurs in a CSTR and one mole of reactant <em>A</em> is consumed in an elemental first-order reaction, the eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003020a">(2.28)</a> yields to:
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003020a">\[\begin{equation}
Q - \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\,\overline{C}_{p,i}\right)\left(T - T_0\right) - F_{A0}\,X_A \, \Delta H_{R}(T) = 0
\tag{2.28}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The <em>Q</em> term in eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003020a">(2.28)</a> depends on the removal scheme used. In general, the rate for heat transfer is:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    q = U \left(T_c - T\right)
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where: <em>q</em> is the heat flux into the reactor <span class="math inline">\(\left(\text{J}/\text{m}^2-\text{h}\right)\)</span>, and <em>U</em> means the overall heat-transfer coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\left(\text{J}/\text{m}^2-\text{h}-\text{K}\right)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(T&lt;Tc\)</span>, heat is transferred into the reactor and <span class="math inline">\(q&gt;0\)</span>. The total heat transfer rate, <em>Q</em>, is obtained by integrating the flux, <em>q</em>, over the whole area of the exchanger. For example, if the temperature of the fluid is the same at every point in the exchanger.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    Q = U\,A_{J} \left(\overline{T}_c - T\right)
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{T}_c\)</span> is the constant temperature of the heat-transfer fluid, and it is equal to the outlet temperature, <span class="math inline">\(T_{c,o}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_J\)</span> is the total area of the heat exchanger.</p>
<p>Substituting in <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003020a">(2.28)</a>,
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003021">\[\begin{equation}
- F_{A0}\,X_A \, \Delta H_{R}(T)
= U\,A_{J} \left(T - T_c\right) + \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\,\overline{C}_{p,i}\right)\left(T - T_0\right)
\tag{2.29}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>To understand the physical meaning of the terms in eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003021">(2.29)</a>, consider an exothermic reaction. The term <span class="math inline">\(\left[- F_{A0}\,X_A \, \Delta H_{R}^\circ(T)\right]\)</span> represents the enthalpy change related to change in composition because of the chemical reaction. While <span class="math inline">\(U\,A_{J} \left(T - T_c\right)\)</span> is the rate at which heat is transferred out of the CSTR. Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\,\overline{C}_{p,i}\right)\left(T - T_0\right)\)</span> represents the increase in sensible heat of the feed as it goes from <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> to <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>Now, we define two functions corresponding to the left-hand side and right-hand of eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003021">(2.29)</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>The first function is:
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003022">\[\begin{equation}
 HPR(T) = - F_{A0}\,X_A\,\Delta H_R(T)
 \tag{2.30}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The function <em>HPR(T)</em> represents the **heat generation* rate in the reactor, proportional to the reaction heat (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_R\)</span>) and conversion degree (<span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span>). For an exothermic reaction, this term will be &gt; 0 and a strong temperature function.</p>
<p>The second function, <em>HWR(T)</em>, is defined from two right-hands terms of the eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003023">(2.31)</a>.
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003023">\[\begin{equation}
HWR(T)  = UA_{J} \left(T - T_c\right) + \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\,\overline{C}_{p,i}\right)\left(T - T_0\right)
\tag{2.31}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Eq <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003023">(2.31)</a> is called the <strong>removal</strong> term because it represents the total heat transfer rate per unit volume of the reaction mixture. In summary, it represents the sensible heat from <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> to <em>T</em> and the heat transferred to the heat-transfer fluid.</p>
<p>Both <em>HPR(T)</em> and <em>HWR(T)</em> allow identifying when the CSRT operates under steady-state conditions and which of them is stable. If <em>HPR(T)</em> <span class="math inline">\(\neq\)</span> <em>HWR(T)</em>, the CSTR is <strong>not</strong> at steady-state.</p>

<p>For reasons of convenience, several different expressions for heat production and heat removal are used. For the heat production with constant density reactions, we have:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the heat production per unit time: <span class="math inline">\(\left(-\Delta H_r\right) \upsilon C_{A0} X_A\)</span></li>
<li>the heat production per unit of volume of reaction mixture: <span class="math inline">\(\left(-\Delta H_r\right) C_{A0} X_A\)</span></li>
<li>the heat production per unit of volume of reaction mixture divided by <span class="math inline">\(\rho C_P\)</span>, the sensible heat per unit of volume of the reaction: <span class="math inline">\(\left(-\Delta H_r\right) C_{A0} X_A/\rho C_P\)</span>. This represents the fraction of the maximum possible temperature increase, which is reached in the reactor.</li>
</ol>
<p>For heat removal, similar expressions can be defined. As long as the HPR and HWR are unit-consistent, all will lead to the same conclusions concerning the reactor design and operation. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-westerterp1984" role="doc-biblioref">Westertep, Van Swaaij, and Beenackers 1984</a>)</span></p>

<h4>Multiple steady-states analysis</h4>
<p>Another essential aspect of CSRT design is to determine if multiple steady-states are raised. This situation is possible because a non-linear equation can have more than one solution. Nevertheless, how is it possible to determine this particular situation?</p>
<p>Let us consider some changes to the situation shown in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003005aaa">2.11</a>. Suppose that the temperature of the feed, <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>, or the cooling fluid temperature, <em>Tc</em>, is reduced. The result of this modification will be to increase the intercept of the HWR(T) line on the y-axis without changing the slope of the line. It means that HWR(T) line shifts to the left, parallel to the original curve, so that it could be more than one operating point. This situation is known as <strong>multiple steady-states</strong></p>
<p>In order to determine if there are multiple steady-states for a CSTR. We are going to follow the next steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Let us fixed inlet conditions.</li>
<li>Let us establish a range for <em>T</em> we are interested in.</li>
<li>For each <em>T</em> in the temperature range, let calculate <em>k</em> and <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(C_A\)</span>).</li>
<li>Again, for each <em>T</em>, the cooling fluid temperature <em>Tc</em> is calculated.</li>
<li>Finally, the set of values for <em>T</em>, <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span>, and <em>Tc</em> is substituted into the reactor energy balance.
When the left-hand side of equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003020a">(2.28)</a> is equal to 0, a steady-state will have been reached.</li>
</ol>
<p>The heat-transfer fluid consumption is calculated from an energy balance around the perfectly mixed jacket at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_J\)</span>. Constant physical properties of the cooling medium are assumed.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ec003024">\[\begin{equation}

<p>When we are dealing with exothermic reactions, several steady states may be possible in a CSTR, which can easily calculate them if we rewrite the equations like so:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
C_A &amp;= \frac{F_0\,C_{A0}}{F+V\,k} \\

\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Now, these equations are solved for a range <span class="math inline">\(500 \leq T \leq 700\)</span>, next their results are evaluated into energy balance function (eq. @ref{eq:ec003020b}) on the reactor.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ec003020b">\[\begin{equation}

\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>These equations are solved for a range from 500 to 700. Next, their results are evaluated into energy balance function on the reactor. The results obtained are plotted vs <span class="math inline">\(T_R\)</span> in figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a> shows the system has three operating-points. Now, how a CSTR can operate at multiple steady-states is necessary to know which is (or which of them) stable for the operating condition.
Thus, the next step in designing a non-isothermal CSTR must be to carry out a steady-state analysis.</p>
<p>Usually, the stability analysis can be done from the plot <em>HPR(T)</em>-<em>HWR(T)</em> vs. reaction temperature.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:fig003008"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.13: Graphical solutions of the heat balance for a CSTR
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003008">2.13</a> shows <em>HPR</em> is a sigmoidal curve because of the rate constant’s exponential temperature dependence. The shape of the curve depends in large part on the value of the activation energy.</p>
<p>All possible reactor operating temperatures must satisfy both functions, <em>HPR</em> and <em>HWR</em>, such that the two functions have equal values. These operating points are represented in Fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003008">2.13</a> by circles.</p>
<p>Additionally, Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003008">2.13</a> shows that the <em>HWR</em> line intercepts the <em>HPR</em> curve in three points at the same temperatures shown in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a>.
Gray dots represent stable conditions, and especially the latter point is of practical interest since it represents a high degree of conversion.</p>
<p>The stable conditions are related to the fact that the heat removal line’s slope should be greater than that of the heat production line. Under that condition, more heat is removed on a positive deviation from the operating point than produced heat so that the reaction temperature will return to the steady-state value.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003008">2.13</a>’s black circle is an unstable operating condition because the situation is reversed than for gray dots. Since the heat production curve slope is here more significant than that of the heat removal line, any positive temperature deviation will be amplified until the reactor works in the upper stable operating point and vice versa.</p>
<p>In summary, the lower stable steady-state operating point in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a> corresponds to low rates of heat generation and removal. This combination may result from one or more of the following factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Small values of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_R\)</span>;</li>
<li>Low value of the reaction rate constant;</li>
<li>Short average residence time;</li>
<li>Small value of the feed rate, and</li>
<li>Fast removal of heat from the reactor, which does not cause the temperature to rise to higher values.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, the higher stable steady-state operating point in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a> corresponds to the reactant’s nearly complete consumption. This outcome is favored by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>An enormous value of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_R\)</span>;</li>
<li>A more considerable value of the reaction rate constant;</li>
<li>Longer average residence time;</li>
<li>Larger reactant throughput, and</li>
<li>A slower heat removal regime by a heat exchanger.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether the reactor operates at a lower or higher stable point depends on how it is started up. The <strong>unsteady energy</strong> and material balances must be solved simultaneously to determine the effect of startup conditions.</p>
<p>The type of stability analysis carried out above is not mathematically rigorous. However, it is a handy way to understand the concept of stable and unstable operating points. In mathematical terms, the above analysis has shown that a steady-state operating will be unstable if
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \left[\frac{\partial HPR(T)}{\partial T}\right]_\text{operating point} &gt; \left[\frac{\partial HWR(T)}{\partial T}\right]_\text{operating point}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>and will be stable if
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \left[\frac{\partial HPR(T)}{\partial T}\right]_\text{operating point} &lt; \left[\frac{\partial HWR(T)}{\partial T}\right]_\text{operating point}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>The first inequality is a sufficient criterion for instability so that the operating point will be intrinsically unstable in this situation. The second inequality is a sufficient criterion for stability, provided that the CSTR is adiabatic. If the reactor is not adiabatic, the second condition is necessary but not sufficient.</p>
<p>It is important to remark that the curve HPR/HRW vs. <em>T</em> performed in Fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003007">2.12</a> corresponds to a simple reaction rate expression <span class="math inline">\(r_A = - k\,C_A\)</span>.
As the reaction change’s characteristics, the shape of that curve will change, and the resulting analysis will need to be accordingly modified.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003009">2.14</a> presents qualitative forms of the HPW/HWR curve for (a) a reversible reaction, (b) a pair of consecutive exothermic reactions, and (c) for two consecutive reactions, where the first is exothermic and the second is endothermic.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Plug-flow reactor (PFR)</h2>
<p>Plug flow is a simplified and idealized picture of a fluid’s motion, whereby all the fluid elements move with a uniform velocity along parallel streamlines. This perfectly ordered flow is the only transport mechanism accounted for in the plug flow reactor model.</p>
<p>In summary, the essential features of a PFR are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The volumetric flow may vary continuously in the direction of the flow because of a change in density,</li>
<li>Each element of fluid is a closed system; that is, there is no axial mixing (it seems a CSTR),</li>
<li>fluid properties may change continuously in the axial direction but are constant radially at a given axial position,</li>
<li>Each element of fluid has the same residence time, t, as any other.</li>
</ol>
<p>This kind of reactor is usually used:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When a high flow rate of the reacting system is needed (fast reactions).</li>
<li>Large scale.</li>
<li>High temperature.</li>
<li>Homogeneous or heterogeneous reactions.</li>
<li>Continuous operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a PFR, the composition of the fluid varies from point to point along a flow path. Thus the material balance for a reaction component must be made for a differential element dV, as shown in Figure X.</p>

<p>The equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002051">(2.39)</a> could be rewritten as a differential equation representing the gradient of <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> for a position (<em>z</em>) in a PFR.
Assuming that the reactor is a cylinder of radius R. The volume of the reactor from the inlet to position is <span class="math inline">\(V(z) = \pi R^2 z\)</span>, so:

<p>Under the traditional approach for sizing reactors, the equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002051">(2.39)</a> is rewritten depending on the reacting fluid density. As far as I understand, it is unnecessary because of software like Python or Matlab, making more straighforward numerical calculations.

<p>The shape of figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig002017">2.16</a> is based on the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(-r_A\)</span> decreases as <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> increases. Thus equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002051">(2.39)</a> states that <span class="math inline">\((V/F_{A0})\)</span> for an ideal PFR is the area under the curve of <span class="math inline">\((1/-r_A)\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span>, between the inlet and outlet fractional conversion.</p>
</div>
<div id="variable-density-system-1" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Variable-Density System</h4>
<p>When the reacting system’s density is not constant throughout a PFR, the size of a PFR must be calculated using the general design equation (Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002051">(2.39)</a>).</p>
<p>For example for an irreversible first-order reaction, which <span class="math inline">\(r_A = - k\,C_A\)</span>. The kinetic equation will be written as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  r_A = - k\,C_A = -k\,\frac{F_A}{\upsilon} = - k\,F_{A0}\:\frac{\left(1-X_A\right)}{\upsilon}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the equation design is
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002054a">\[\begin{equation}
\tau = - C_{A0} \int_0^{X_A} \frac{d\,X_A}{r_A} = C_{A0} \int_0^{X_A} \frac{\upsilon\:d\,X_A}{k\:F_{A0}\:\left(1-X_A\right)} = \frac{1}{k\:\upsilon_0} \int_0^{X_A} \frac{\upsilon\:d\,X_A}{1-X_A}
\tag{2.42}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Taking into account that, in this case, <span class="math inline">\(\upsilon = \upsilon_0 \left(1 + \varepsilon_A\,X_A\right)\)</span> then <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002054a">(2.42)</a> becomes
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002054">\[\begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{1}{k} \int_0^{X_A} \frac{\left(1 + \varepsilon_A X_A\right)}{1-X_A}\:dX_A
  \tag{2.40}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>As it was mentioned before, for ideal PFR, all fluid elements take the same length of time in the reactor. This time is called <strong>mean residence time</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\overline t\)</span>) and, in general, it could be calculated by:
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002056">\[\begin{equation}
    \overline{t} = \int_{0}^{V} \frac{dV}{\upsilon}
    \tag{2.43}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\upsilon\)</span> is the volumetric flow rate.</p>
<p>The space-time and the mean residence time are identical when there is no density change in the reactor.
For analyzing kinetic data obtained from tubular reactors, the <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is a more useful variable than <em>t</em> because the former is an independent variable. In contrast, the latter only can be obtained if the progressive changes occurring within the reactor are known beforehand.</p>
<div class="infobox info">
<p>For systems of constant density, the performance equations are identical for a BR and PFR, which means <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> for PFR is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for the BR</p>

and n = 0, 1, 2, or 3 according to the reaction’s order. As an initial condition for eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq058">(2.44)</a> is that there is no conversion at the reactor inlet.

<p>The enthalpy term can be broken apart into two terms:

<p>Any form of energy balance equation must be combined with the molar balance over PFR to obtain the temperature and concentration profiles along the reactor. In cases in which pressure could not be neglected, the momentum balance must be added.</p>
<p>One standard method of reactor operation is having a phase change taking place in the heat transfer fluid, that is, a boiling or condensing fluid use. In this operating mode, <span class="math inline">\(T_\infty\)</span> is constant, and the energy balance equation is solving based on that supposition.</p>
<p>Another useful assumption is considering an average heat capacity value (composition independent) which gives the following equation.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dL} = \frac{\pi\,U\,D}{\dot{m}\,\overline{C}_P}\left(T_{\infty}-T\right) + \frac{\pi\,D^2}{4 \dot{m}\,\overline{C}_P}\Delta H_{R,A}\,r_A

<p>From temperature analysis, there are four essential differences between PFRs and CSTRs.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The variation properties with axial position down the length of the reactor. In CSTR, the maximum reaction temperature is reached at the exit of the reactor under steady-state conditions.
However, in a PFR, the peak temperature usually occurs at an intermediate axial position in the reactor. (assuming irreversible and exothermic reaction).</li>
<li>In a CSTR, a change over an input variable has an immediate effect on variables inside the reactor. In contrast, a PFR takes time for the disturbance to work its way through the reactor to exit. Thus there are significant dynamic lags and dead time between changes made at the inlet of the reactor and temperatures and compositions further down the reactor’s length.</li>
<li>It is mechanically impossible to control the reaction temperature at each axial position down the PFR. Only a single temperature can be controlled, which can be the peak temperature or exit temperature.</li>
<li>In CSTR, the inlet temperature is not the most critical process variable but, in the case of a PFR, it is a design and control variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The primary assumption about flow pattern in a PFR is relatively reasonable for an adiabatic reactor.
However, for non-adiabatic reactors, radial temperature gradients are inherent features.
However, if tube diameters are kept small, the plug flow assumption is more suitable.</p>

<p>A recycling reactor is an ideal tubular reactor that part of the effluent stream back to the reactor inlet. As shown in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig002021">2.19</a>.

Figure 2.19: Recycle PFR
</p>
</div>
<p>Based on the flowsheet in Fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig002021">2.19</a>, the feed to the process is denoted by the subscript ‘’o’’ with is mixed at the point M with the recycle stream, denoted by a subscript ‘’R’‘. The mixed stream, which is denoted by a subscript’‘in’’, is then fed to the reactor.</p>
<p>At point S, the outlet stream from the reactor, which is denoted by a subscript ‘’out’‘, is split into recycle stream and the final stream leaving the process (denoted by a subscript’‘f’’). The recycle ratio, <em>R</em>, as defined as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
R = \frac{\upsilon_R}{\upsilon_f} = \frac{F_{\text{tot},R}}{F_{\text{tot},f}} = \frac{F_{A,R}}{F_{A,f}} 
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\upsilon\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are the volumetric and molar flow, respectively.</p>
<p>If the fresh feed <span class="math inline">\(F_o\)</span> contains a molar fraction <span class="math inline">\(x_{Ao}\)</span>, and the reactor product a molar fraction <span class="math inline">\(x_{A}\)</span> of the specie <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then the molar balance for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at point <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
F_{A,in} = F_{A,0} + F_{A,R} = F_{A,0} + R \, F_{A,f}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> balance at point S is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
F_{A,out} = F_{A,f} + F_{A,R} = F_{A,f} + R \, F_{A,f} = \left(1 + R \right) F_{A,f} \Rightarrow F_{A,f} = \frac{F_{A,out}}{1 + R}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>Combining those last two equations, the desired expression for the initial value of the molar flow rate of A will be:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
F_{A,in} = F_{A,0} + R\,\frac{F_{A,out}}{1 + R}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>The material balance may obtain the volume of the recycled PFR for the reactant <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> into the reactor, which is
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq064">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{V }{F_\text{in}} = - \int_{X_{A,\text{in}} }^{X_A} {\frac{dX_A }{r_A }}
\tag{2.63}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>However, there are at least two ways to define the conversion of a system like this. One is the per-pass conversion given in eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ecconglobal">(2.65)</a> and the other is the overall conversion given in equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ecconglobal">(2.65)</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ecconglobal" id="eq:ecconpass">\[\begin{gather}
X_{A,pass} = \frac{F_{A,in} - F_{A,out}}{F_{A,in}} \tag{2.64} \\ 
X_{A,overall} = \frac{F_{A,0} - F_{A,f}}{F_{A,0}} \tag{2.65} 
\end{gather}\]</span></p>
<p>It is essential to consider that the reactor’s volumetric flow rate is greater than the volumetric flow rate entering the process when the rate expression contains concentrations.</p>
<p>The definition of concentration (eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eccondef">(2.66)</a>) is used as usual. For a gas-phase system, the volumetric flow rate, in the denominator, is written using an appropriate equation of state.
<span class="math display" id="eq:eccondef">\[\begin{equation}
  C_i = \frac{F_i}{\upsilon}
  \tag{2.66}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, if the fluid is a liquid of constant density, the reactor’s volumetric flow rate must be used according to Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ecconcliquid">(2.67)</a>
<span class="math display" id="eq:ecconcliquid">\[\begin{equation}
  C_i  =\frac{F_i}{\upsilon_{in}}  = \frac{F_i}{\upsilon_{0}\left(1 + R\right)}
  \tag{2.67}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>When the recycled PFR operates at non-isothermal temperature, the initial condition for the temperature is found at point M while noting that <span class="math inline">\(T_{out} = T_R = T_f\)</span>. Assuming that no phase change occurs in any of the streams, the heat balance would be:
<span class="math display" id="eq:echeatbalanceM">\[\begin{equation}
  \sum_i \left(F_{i,0} \int_{T_0}^{T_{in}} C_{P,i} dT \right) +  \sum_i \left(F_{i,R} \int_{T_R}^{T_{in}} C_{P,i} dT \right) = 0
  \tag{2.68}
\end{equation}\]</span>
Therefore, the temperature of the stream ‘’in’’
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  T_{in} = T_0\,\frac{\sum_i \left(F_{i,0}  C_{P,i} \right) + T_R\, \sum_i \left(F_{i,R} C_{P,i}\right)}{\sum_i \left(F_{i,in}  C_{P,i} \right) }
  (\#eq:ectemp_in)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In summary, the performance of a non-isothermal recycle PFR must be calculate
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  &amp;\frac{dF_i}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum \nu_{i,j} r_j \\
  &amp; \pi D U \left(T_e - T\right) = \left(\sum F_i C_{P,i}\right)\frac{dT}{dz} + \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \sum r_j \Delta H_j \\
  &amp; F_i \left(z =0\right) = F_{i,in} = F_{i,0} + \frac{R}{1+R} F_{i,out} \\
  &amp; T \left(z=0\right) = T_{in}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>This EDO system must be solved using successive substitution because the flow rate and temperature of stream ``in’’ usually are not provided. To calculate the initial values of these variables is necessary to know the molar flow rate and temperature of the stream ‘’out’’. However, <span class="math inline">\(F_{i,in}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{in}\)</span> are needed to integrate the design equation and calculate <span class="math inline">\(F_{i,out}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{out}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The problem could be solved by calculating an initial guess for the conditions of stream ``in’’ assuming that there is no recycle stream. The previous calculation provides an educated-guess for the composition and temperature of the recycle stream ‘’R’’. The rest of the calculations are performed using these values as initial conditions.</p>
<p>Under isothermal operation and assuming that <span class="math inline">\(F_0 = F_f\)</span>, and noting that <span class="math inline">\(x_{A,R} = x_{A,out} = x_{A,f}\)</span>, the problem is much easier to solve. A balance for <em>A</em> at point M.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  F_0\,x_{A,0} + F_R\,x_{A,R}  = F_\text{in}\,x_{A,in}
\end{equation*}\]</span>
Now, a balance on the reactor
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  F_\text{in} = F_{out} = F_f \left(1 + R\right) \equiv F_0 \left(1 + R\right) 
\end{equation*}\]</span>
Therefore
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
      x_{A,\text{in}} &amp;= \frac{F_0\,x_{A,0} + F_R \,x_{A,f}}{F_\text{in}} \\
                &amp; = \frac{F_0\,x_{A,0} + F_0\,R\,x_{A,f}}{F_{out}} = \frac{F_0\left( x_{A,0} + R\,x_{A,f}\right)}{F_0 \left(1 + R\right) } 
\end{align*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(x_{A,k}\)</span> referred to molar fraction of A in the stream <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span></p>
<p>Then, the total reactor feed contains a molar fraction <span class="math inline">\(x_{A,\text{in}}\)</span>, given by
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq063">\[\begin{equation}
        x_{A,\text{in}} = \frac{x_{Ao} + R\,x_{A}}{1+R} 
        \tag{2.69}
    \end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The fractional conversion in the stream entering the reactor <span class="math inline">\(X_{A,\text{in}}\)</span> is not zero since this stream is a combination of fresh feed and the recycle stream. Thus the fractional conversion at the reactor inlet is:
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq065">\[\begin{align}
    X_{A,\text{in}} =&amp; \frac{x_{Ao} - x_{A,\text{in}}}{x_{Ao}}  \notag \\
    &amp; = \frac{1}{x_{Ao}} \left( x_{Ao}  - \frac{x_{Ao} + R\,x_{A}}{1+R}\right) \notag \\
    X_{A,\text{in}} &amp; = \frac{R}{1 + R} X_A
    \tag{2.70}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq065">(2.70)</a> in <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq064">(2.63)</a>
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq066">\[\begin{equation}
    V= - F_0 \left( 1 + R \right)\int_{ \frac{R}{1 + R} X_A}^{X_A} {\frac{dX_A }{r_A }}
    \tag{2.71}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In this case, <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> represents the overall conversion which means
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  X_A = \frac{\text{moles of A reacted overall}}{\text{mole of fresh feed}}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>For the particular case where density changes are negligible, we may write <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:eq066">(2.71)</a> in terms of concentrations,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

<p>It could be interesting to know the <strong>per pass conversion of <em>A</em></strong>, which is the fraction of the total feed of reactant A converted in a single pass through the reactor.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Analysis of Equilibrium-Limited Adiabatic Reactors</h2>
<p>Suppose we are asked to analyze the behavior of a single reaction taking place in an adiabatic reactor. One of the questions we might want to answer is: "What is the maximum conversion that can be achieved?’’</p>
<p>Of course, the maximum conversion is obtained when the reaction reaches chemical equilibrium. This situation will be reached for an infinite reactor volume or an infinite weight of the catalyst. Nevertheless, the composition and temperature of the effluent from any reactor will be determined by the reaction’s kinetics.</p>
<p>In any case, a reactor’s performance is susceptible to the temperature of the inlet stream, which is especially true for PFRs, and for reactors that operate adiabatically. Thus, it is vital to consider the type of reaction we are dealing with: exothermic, endothermic, irreversible, or reversible.</p>
<p>Temperature, composition, and reaction rate are uniquely related to any single homogeneous reaction, and this way is represented graphically in one of three ways, as shown in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003029">2.21</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Adiabatic reactors</h3>
<p>The simplest and cheapest mode of reactor design and operation is the adiabatic model. If heat is added to or withdrawn from the reactor as the reaction proceeds, the heat-exchange surface must be designed into the reactor, increasing the capital cost substantially.
However, an adiabatic reaction is practicable when the resulting temperatures stay in a workable range. That is, when they did not drop so that the rate becomes too small or rise until the rate becomes uncontrollable. The following conditions are favorable to adiabatic operation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When the heat of reaction is small.</li>
<li>When it is possible to adjust the initial temperature to not take the system out of the workable range.</li>
<li>When the heat capacity of the equipment or the solvent or any inert materials that may be present is sufficient to moderate the temperature effect.</li>
<li>When an inert material is present or introduced without harm, it can moderate temperature changes by vaporization or condensation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The construction of an adiabatic reactor is relatively simple, and the capital cost is relatively low, so its design should always be considered. A more complex design should be used only when there are compelling reasons.</p>
<p>For the design of nonisothermal operation, these necessary data are needed: <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-walas1989" role="doc-biblioref">Walas 1989</a>)</span></p>

<li>The specific reaction rate as a function of temperature.</li>
<li>The system’s thermal data, such as the heat capacities and sensible and latent enthalpies of all participants and inert materials present, as functions of temperature.</li>

For any continuous flow reactor working under adiabatic mode, the energy balance is calculated by

<p>This system of equations was implemented and solved with <a href="https://github.com/aliglara/ebook_che5314_ucv/blob/main/codes/lect_012PFRadiabatico.ipynb">Python</a>, and the graphical solution for the concentration and temperature profiles are shown in Fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:solprofiles">2.22</a>.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the concentration profile for the adiabatic PFR with the solution for the reactor maintained isothermally at 300 K. These solutions are plotted in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003024">2.23</a>.</p>

<p>From Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003024">2.23</a>, it is worthy to point out when the PFR operates in adiabatic mode, a shorter <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> to attain complete conversion is required than under isothermal operation. Otherwise, the isothermal reactor curve exhibiting a standard exponential decay, but the adiabatic reactor shows an acceleration in rate as the reaction proceeds because the temperature increases.</p>
<p>The same problem was solved for an adiabatic CSTR, and both profiles obtained were compared with PFR profiles in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003025">2.24</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003025">2.24</a> shows that the temperature profile and concentration profile have a similar shape. The difference is that temperature increases while concentration decreases for this exothermic reaction.</p>
<p>Otherwise, from the comparison between PFR and CSTR, it is possible to note that, in this example, the CSTR requires a shorter residence time for a given conversion than a PFR. Finally, CSTR profiles’ shapes suggest multiple steady states approximately at <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 1.5\)</span> min.</p>
<p>To identify those operating points, we will rewrite the material and energy balance for our adiabatic CSTR.</p>
<p>The material balance is
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003042a">\[\begin{align}
  &amp;\upsilon\,C_{A0} - \upsilon\,C_A + r_A\,V = 0 \notag \\
  &amp;C_{A0} - C_A = -r_A\,\tau \notag \\
  &amp;C_{A0} - C_A = k(T)\,C_A\,\tau \notag \\
  &amp;C_A = C_{A0} \, \frac{k(T)}{1 + \tau\,k(T)}
  \tag{2.75}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The energy balance is
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003042b">\[\begin{align}
  &amp;\upsilon\, \rho C_P \left(To - T\right) - k(T)\,C_A\,\Delta H_r\,V = 0 \notag \\
  &amp;\frac{\rho C_P}{\tau} \left(To - T\right) - k(T)\,C_A\,\Delta H_r = 0
  \tag{2.76}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The first term of Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003042a">(2.75)</a> represents the removal of heat, and the second one is associated with generating heat. When both terms have the same value, then the CSTR will be operating at steady-state conditions.</p>
<p>Now, to identify possible steady-state operating points. First, we set a residence time, in our case 1.5 min. Second, we set the evaluating temperature range, which is 300 - 340 K. Finally, Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003042a">(2.75)</a> is substituted into Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003042b">(2.76)</a> and the resulting equation is evaluated for each temperature from the temperature range.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003026">2.25</a> shows the energy balance for our CSTR at <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 1.5\)</span> min, following the procedure described before, and it is possible to identify three operating points.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Selecting the best reactor for adiabatic operation</h3>
<p>In any case, it is important to know the optimum temperature progression because it will assure the minimum <span class="math inline">\(V/F_{A0}\)</span> for a given conversion of reactant. This optimum may be isothermal, or it may be a changing temperature: in time for a batch reactor, along the length of the PFR, or from stage to stage for a series of mixed flow reactors.</p>
<p>In order to select the best adiabatic continuous-flow reactor for carrying out a reaction, it is suitable to analyze the <span class="math inline">\(1/r\)</span> plot because either for isothermal or nonisothermal reactors, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is still the area under curves of plots 1/r versus <span class="math inline">\(C_{A0} - C_A\)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, the size of reactor required for a given duty and a given temperature progression is found as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Draw the reaction path on the <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> vs. <em>T</em> plot, which is the operating line for the operation.</li>
<li>Find the rates at various <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> along this path.</li>
<li>Plot the <span class="math inline">\(1/r_A\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> curve for this path.</li>
<li>Find the area under this curve, which gives <span class="math inline">\(V/F_{A0}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>This procedure is general, applicable for any kinetics, temperature progression, reactor type, or reactor series. Thus, once the operating line is known, the reactor size can be found. For exothermic reactions, this procedure is illustrated in Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003028">2.26</a> for three paths.</p>

<p>In an exothermic reaction, the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_R &lt; 0\)</span> ; therefore, increasing the reaction temperature decreases the equilibrium chemical constant (<em>K</em>) value, with a concomitant decrease in the equilibrium yield.

<p>Fig. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003013">2.29</a> also shows two lines that represent operation modes for the reactor: adiabatic and isothermal modes. For adiabatic mode, the line governs the relationship between the temperature and the fractional conversion, assuming <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_P\)</span> are constant, as presented in equations Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003034">(2.73)</a> and Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003040">(2.103)</a>.</p>
<p>In this operation mode, the temperature and the fractional conversion will increase along this line until the equilibrium curve is encountered at <strong>Te</strong> and <strong>Xe</strong>. At this point, the rate is zero, so any additional change, neither composition nor temperature, will not occur.</p>
<p>If the same reactor operates isothermally, the change of composition will follow the vertical line, and the final fractional conversion will be determined, again, for the chemical equilibrium curve.</p>
<p>Although the final conversion (<em>X</em>) will be higher for an isothermal mode than for an adiabatic mode at the same initial temperature (<span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>), the isothermal operation may not be practical because of the required reactor volume.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is necessary to determine the optimal temperature progression along the reactor to maximize the conversion for the minimum possible reactor volume, which is shown as a dashed line in figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003014">2.30</a>.</p>

<p>In figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003014">2.30</a>, each solid line represents a locus of the set of temperature and conversion that gives a specified value of rate.
At a constant reaction rate, the conversion initially rises rapidly with increasing temperature and then begins to fall due to a faster reverse reaction’s rising rate. The top line (equilibrium line) corresponds to a reaction rate of zero.</p>
<p>The dashed line gives a trajectory of maximum reaction rates as a function of the conversion called "the locus of maximum reaction rates’’. This locus is independent of the type of reactor used, and for a given conversion, the reactor volume is minimum if the temperature of operation is selected to correspond to the maximum reaction rate.</p>
<p>The temperature at which the conversion rate is a maximum will be somewhat lower than Te and is determined by the condition.

<p>In practice, it may be challenging to achieve an optimal temperature profile within a reactor. Therefore other designs are often used.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For relatively fast reactions that are equilibrium limited, the adiabatic reactor is commonly used in the industry.</li>
<li>Where very high conversions are desired, it is common to use multiple reactors in series, with cooling between each reactor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003015">2.31</a> shows a typical conversion path for multiple adiabatic reactors in series. Each diagonal line represents one reactor, which operates adiabatically until the fixed conversion is reached.
For example, <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> then the process stream is cooled by passing it through a heat exchanger until a predetermined temperature (in this stage, there is no conversion). Afterward, the process stream enters the next reactor (Bed 2) and so on.</p>

<p>In designing reactor systems with interstage cooling, one crucial question that must be addressed is how the reactor stages should be sized. Should all the temperature differences between inlet and outlet be equal? Or is there some optimum distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span>’s? The latter would imply an optimum in the number of reactor stages and (in the case of catalytic reactions) an optimum distribution of mass of catalyst between the reactor stages.</p>
<p>In the end, the exact number of the reactor and the degree of cooling between them depends on the reaction involved and operating and capital costs.
However, it is clear that the system is very complex, and the optimum to be arrived at would depend on the type of objective function(s) that are adopted.</p>
<p>When dealing with a series of PFR, the application of Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003054">(2.81)</a> is quite tricky. However, the optimum temperature profile can be found based on the assumption that the criterion Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003044">(2.78)</a> and hence also equation Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003054">(2.81)</a> must be valid for any cross-section of the reactor.</p>
<p>The volume of a PFR is proportional to the integral
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003056">\[\begin{equation}
\int_0^{X_{A,L}} \frac{dX_A}{r_A}
\tag{2.83}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>From the optimum temperature policy, this integral should be a minimum which leads to the condition
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003057">\[\begin{equation}
\int_0^{X_{A,L}} \frac{\partial r_A}{\partial T}\,\frac{dX_A}{r_A^2}=0
\tag{2.84}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In order to the highest possible final conversion for a given number of sections based on a given entrance temperature of the first section, the conditions must be met:
For each section, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> equation X becomes to
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003058">\[\begin{equation}

where <span class="math inline">\(X_{A,N}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are related by</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ec003059">\[\begin{equation}

\tag{2.86}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>

<p>The feed enters the first stage at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_{1,0}(X_{1,0}=0)\)</span> and the reaction is heated up proportionally to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> following equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003059">(2.86)</a>.

For this reason, figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003017">2.33</a> shows that at low temperatures, the conversion is scanty because of detained specific reaction rates.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> The Batch Reactor (BR)</h2>
<p>A batch reactor (BR) is a spatially uniform closed system whose concentration parameters are established at time zero.

Therefore, it is assumed that in an ideal batch reactor.</p>
<div class="infobox info">
<p>At any time, the batch is uniform in composition and temperature at every point in the reactor.</p>
</div>
<p>Batch reactors are generally used for liquid-phase reactions. When a solid catalyst has to be kept in suspension or two liquid phases, an agitator is required. Since the batch reactor (BR) has no flow streams, and as a consequence that the reaction mixture is homogeneous, that is, all contents are in a single phase. Perfect mixing is also assumed, which means that there are no spatial variations in temperature and composition. The composition changes with time, however. Temperature sequencing may be favorable for the selectivity of achieving complete conversion in a safe way. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-froment2011" role="doc-biblioref">Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011</a>)</span></p>
<p>If all reactants are charged to the reactor, its concentration initially is large, which means that the reaction rate and the heat transfer load are high at the beginning of the batch cycle unless the temperature keeps low for external heat-transfer equipment.</p>
<p>For better control of temperature, this type of operation may not be advisable, and the reactant(s) may have to be added progressively to the vessel’s contents. The reactor is then said to operate in semi-batch mode. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-froment2011" role="doc-biblioref">Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011</a>)</span></p>

<p>Equation <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002002">(2.89)</a> is referred to as the <strong>design equation</strong> for an ideal batch reactor, and it is valid no matter how many homogeneous reactions are taking place.

<h4>Constant-Volume Batch Reactor</h4>
<p>If the reactor volume is constant, then the mass density of the system, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> (mass/volume), must also be constant since the mass of material in a batch reactor does not change with time. In this case, it is possible to rewrite the molar balance (Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002002">(2.89)</a>) directly in terms of concentrations.
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002004">\[\begin{equation}

</div>
<p>For batch reactors, it is important to know how much time is required for reactants to achieve a certain conversion <em>X</em>. For this reason, the molar balance is in terms of conversion. Let us assume we are dealing with a reactant specie, <em>A</em>.

<p>The assumption of constant volume is valid for the most industrial batch reactor. The mass density is approximately constant for a large majority of liquids, even if the temperature changes moderately as the reaction proceeds.

<h4>Variable-Volume Batch Reactor</h4>
<p>In a variable-volume batch reactor, the volume of the reacting mixture changes over time for two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>external means (e.g., filling a reaction vessel or adding a second reactant), which is often termed ‘’semi-batch’’ operation, and</li>
<li>changes in densities of reactants or products (e.g., molar expansion of gases), which is not commonly used in industry because of the small mass capacity. However, at the laboratory level, gas-phase reactors have been utilized.</li>
</ol>
<p>If <em>V</em> change over time, Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002002">(2.89)</a> in terms of concentrations would be:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}\]</span>
which is more complex than Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002004">(2.90)</a>.</p>
<p>However, for a critical reactant, an alternating way is to rewrite Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002006">(2.92)</a> in terms of fractional conversion because a change in the volume yields a change in concentrations.</p>
<p>Usually, a batch reactor operates isothermally, and the pressure drop is neglected thus
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
   V = V_0 \left(1 + \varepsilon_A\,X \right)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>From this relationship, the design equation for a batch reactor (Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec002002">(2.89)</a>) is written as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    r_A\left(X_A\right) = - \frac{1}{V_0 \left(1 + \varepsilon_A\,X_A \right)}\frac{dN_A}{dt}
\end{equation}\]</span>
and their solutions are:
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002024">\[\begin{equation} 
  t = N_{A0} \int_{0}^{X_A} \frac{dX_A}{\left(-r_A\right)V_0\left(1+\varepsilon_A\,X_A\right)} = C_{j0} \int_{0}^{X_A} \frac{dX_A}{\left(-r_A\right)\left(1+\varepsilon_A\,X_A\right)}

<p>It is not always possible, or even desirable, to carry out a reaction under isothermal conditions in practice. In this situation, both the energy and mass balances must be solved simultaneously.</p>
<p>It is known that a batch reactor is a closed system. Otherwise, in most cases, the work done by the stirrer is neglected unless the mixture is highly viscous and the stirring operation draws significant power. Under this scenario, Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:energybal">(2.3)</a> becomes

    \frac{dU}{dt}= Q - W_s

\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>By convenience, let us rewrite Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003002">(2.95)</a> in terms of enthalpy,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    \frac{dH}{dt} - P\frac{dv}{dt} - v\frac{dP}{dt} = Q - P\frac{dv}{dt}

<p>Doing some math, over a multicomponent system of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> components, Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003003">(2.96)</a> becomes to

<p>In general, when dealing with a batch reactor, it will be required to calculate the reaction temperature and fractional conversion as a function of time under given conditions of heat supply or removal, or to calculate the heating or cooling requirements for obtaining a desired temperature and reactor capacity.</p>

<p><em>Solution</em>. To solve the problem, we are going to apply the energy balance for a batch reactor that operates at constant-pressure (eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003007">(2.100)</a>).
This equation will combine with the mass balance equation and the kinetic rate law of the reaction, following the operation policies described before.</p>
<p><strong>Case I</strong>. First policy of operation (see Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig0030203">2.38</a>)</p>
<p><em>Step 1</em>. Heating up. During this step, the chemical reaction is not taking place. It is just a preheat of the reaction mixture.
The energy balance for an incompressible fluid without external heat exchange and chemical conversion becomes to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT(t)}{dt} =\frac {U_s\,A\left(T_s - T(t)\right)}{C_P\,V_R}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(T_s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_s\)</span> is the operating temperature and the global heat transfer coefficient for steam, respectively.</p>
<p>This ODE was integrated from <span class="math inline">\(T = 20 \,^\circ\)</span>C and <span class="math inline">\(T = 55 \,^\circ\)</span>C (ec. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003013">(2.104)</a>) and it is found that the latter temperature is reached after 2015.69 seconds.
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003013">\[\begin{equation}
    T (t) =T_s + \exp \left(-\frac{U\,A\,t}{C_P\,V_R}\right) \left(20 - T_s \right) 
\tag{2.104}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><em>Step 2</em>. Reaction under adiabatic operation. Now, it is necessary to combine mass balance, kinetic rate with energy balance.
Thus, the ODEs system to be solved is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    \frac{d X_A}{dt} &amp;= k\left(1-X_A\right) \\
    \frac{dT}{dt} &amp;= - \frac{\Delta H_{R_A}^\circ\,C_{A0}}{C_P} \frac{d X_A}{dt}
\end{align*}\]</span>
This system required 4063.6 seconds for reached 90% of conversion. The final temperature was 90.79 <span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C.</p>
<p><em>Step 3</em>. Cooling down. This stage will be solved under same assumptions set out in first stage but using water as refrigerant fluid.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    \frac{dT(t)}{dt} =\frac {U_c\,A\left(T_c - T(t)\right)}{C_P\,V_R}
\end{equation*}\]</span>
In this stage, the system was cooled to 45 <span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C in 4997.43 seconds.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#fig:fig003004">2.40</a> (a) shows the reactor temperature profile compared to setpoint temperature (340 K). This figure is consistent with the regular mode operation of a BR depicted for high exothermic reactions.</p>
<p>In (b), the behavior of the hot fluid and cold fluid rate is observed.
The maximum flow rate of the cold stream occurs at the end of the ramp when the temperature (<span class="math inline">\(T_{R,\text{max}}\)</span>) exceeded 340 K (approx. 350K).
Now, the reaction slows down, and when <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> starts to drop, the cooling flow rate is gradually reduced to maintain <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> at the desired level.</p>
<p>In general, at <span class="math inline">\(T_{R,\text{max}}\)</span> for the reaction
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}

<p>For a batch reactor is crucial that the cooling system could maintain <span class="math inline">\(T_{R,\text{max}}\)</span> and that the sensibility of <span class="math inline">\(T_{R,\text{max}}\)</span> towards the cooling medium inlet temperatura <span class="math inline">\(T_\text{cold}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(dT_{R,\text{max}}/dT_{\text{cold}}\)</span> should be lower than 1 in order to have a dampening effect.</p>

<p>The same problem was solved for two different diameters for the reactor to analyze the effect over reactor performance and stability of the reaction.

<h4>Batch Reactor at constant-volume</h4>
<p>Nevertheless, when the reactor operates at constant volume, the boundary work is zero so let us rewrite the energy balance for a batch reactor (from Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003005">(2.98)</a>) in reasonable terms. The variation of the pressure can be derived from the total differential of volume.</p>

<p>Now, forming time derivatives for Eq. <a href="ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html#eq:ec003008">(2.105)</a>,
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec003010">\[\begin{equation}

<p>Therefore, the energy balance for a batch reactor that operates at <strong>constant volume</strong> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>For most liquid reactions, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V_j \approx 0\)</span> is usually a good approximation. With this approximation <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_R \approx \Delta U_R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_P \approx C_V\)</span>.</p>
<p>In a gas-phase reacting system, there are two cases: there is no change in moles on reaction, and it follows that
<span class="math display">\[\sum_{j=1}^R \nu_j = 0 \text{ and } \, \sum_{j=1}^R \Delta V_j = 0\]</span></p>
<p>In the second case, there is a change in moles on reaction. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\sum \nu_j = \Delta N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sum \Delta V_j \neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The use of a jacket surrounding the reactor is probably the most common method providing heat transfer because it is relatively inexpensive in terms of equipment cost. However, the most effective heat exchange equipment configuration will be determined by the amount of heat that must be added or removed from the reactor to keep optimum conversion of the key reactant into the desired product.</p>

<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002025">\[\begin{equation}

<p>The production rate is calculated based on reaction time, <em>t</em>, and the turnaround time, <span class="math inline">\(t_t\)</span>, between batches. This turnaround time might involve: charge the reactor with reactants, heat the contents to a specified temperature, the reaction time, cool the reactor contents down to ambient temperature, drain the contents of the reactor, cleaning and prepare the reactor for the next batch.</p>
<p>Thus, the total time per batch or cycle time is:

    t_c = t + t_t

<p>The rate of production of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> on a continual basis is then

<p>In any case, an optimization problem should be solved to answer them. This optimization problem could have two points of view:</p>

<li>Economic: Compare the economics of further conversion to a different use of equipment.</li>
<li>Chemical: How about the quality of the product?</li>

<h4>Optimal Temperature Policies</h4>
<p>When you want to answer questions like:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the best single temperature of operation?</li>
<li>What is the best temperature progression during the reaction time or, in other words, the best trajectory?</li>
</ol>
<p>For single reactions, the results are relatively straightforward. If the reaction is <em>irreversible</em>, and if the rate increases with temperature, the optimal temperature for either maximum conversion from a given reactor operation, or minimum time for the desired conversion, is the highest temperature possible. This highest temperature, <span class="math inline">\(T_\text{max}\)</span>, is imposed by other considerations such as reactor materials and catalyst physical properties. Similarly, for reversible <em>endothermic</em> reactions where the equilibrium conversion increases with temperature <span class="math inline">\(\left(E_{for.} &gt; E_{rev.}\right)\)</span>, the highest allowable temperature is the best policy.</p>
<p>The case of reversible exothermic reactions is complicated because even though the rate may increase with temperature, once the equilibrium conversion s reached, higher temperatures hurt the equilibrium conversion. Thus, there is an optimum intermediate temperature where reasonably rapid rates are obtained with a sufficiently high equilibrium conversion. I will dig into that subject later.</p>

<p>On any chemical scheme shown before, we must design or analyze a reactor system in which multiple reactions occur. In general, our work would have two simultaneous objectives:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To produce the <strong>desired</strong> product at the specified production rate using the most miniature reactor. (maximize the reaction rate)</li>
<li>To minimize the formation of <strong>low-value by-products</strong>. (maximize the reaction yield)</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless, there are no general rules for achieving both objectives because they are usually incompatible. Although in most cases, product distribution controls.</p>
<p>Frequently, there is a trade-off between reaction rate and yield. Ultimately, this trade-off requires economic analysis. Typically, the final analysis often favors selectivity over rate because there is a significant and <em>continuing</em> cost penalty associated with converting a valuable raw material into low-value by-products.</p>
<p>There are two types of problems that arise in multiple-reaction systems:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first is analogous to the kind of problem associated with single reactions. In this category are questions such as: Given a system of reactions with known kinetics, what reaction time (or space-time) will be required to obtain a specified concentration of reactant or product, and what concentrations of the other species will exist at this time?</li>
<li>The second type of problem does not involve reaction time or space-time. The question here is given a system of reactions with known kinetics, and given the concentration of one component at some (unspecified) time (or space-time), what are the concentrations of the other species at that time (or space-time)? This type of problem is referred to as a ’‘<em>time-independent</em>’’ problem. Time-independent problems can be solved by forming the ratio of various reaction rates to eliminate time (or space-time) as an explicit variable. However, the solution to such problems provides no information about the time or reactor volume required to obtain a given composition.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although fractional conversion still is a valid concept, even when more than one reaction takes place. However, the conversion of a single reactant is not sufficient to describe the progress of more than one reaction or to define the complete composition of a system in which more than one reaction occurs. Thus, it is more convenient to deal with concentrations rather than fractional conversions and examine product distribution. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-roberts2009" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts 2009</a>)</span></p>
<p>In industrial practice, high conversion rates are essential, but the yield of desired products plays a tremendous role in chemical reactor design.
Thus, attempts are often made at the expense of reactor capacity to increase the production of desired products and suppress the formation of undesired ones.</p>
<p>For a reaction system like this one</p>
<center>
<p><img src="figures/complexreactions05.png" /></p>
</center>
<p>The ability to convert a reactant into the desired product, <strong>P</strong>, minimizing the formation of undesired product, <strong>X</strong>, is measured by <strong><em>Yield</em></strong>. The <strong><em>overall yield</em></strong> to desired product <em>P</em> with respect to reactant <em>A</em> is defined as
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002072">\[\begin{equation}
  \widetilde{Y}_{P} = \frac{\text{All moles of P formed}}{\text{All moles of A reacted}} = \frac{\nu_A}{\nu_P} \frac{N_P - N_{P0}}{N_A - N_{A0}}
\tag{2.112}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The overall yield refers to the performance of the entire reactor as a whole. Either it operates continuously or in batch mode. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{Y}_P\)</span> is dependent on the reaction conditions and the reactor type.</p>
<p>However, it is often convenient to use a second type of yield called , <span class="math inline">\(Y_P\)</span>, which determines to what extent reactant <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is being converted into <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> at some place or at some moment in the reactor. It is define as the ratio of reaction rate of a given product to the reaction rate of the key reactant <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002073">\[\begin{equation}
    Y_P = - \frac{r_P}{r_A}
\tag{2.113}
\end{equation}\]</span>
Here, <span class="math inline">\(Y_P\)</span> will be 1 when all of the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> that reacts is converted into the desired product, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</p>
<p>The overall yield is the average of the instantaneous yield integrates over the reactor. The overall yield concerns us because it represents the product distribution at the reactor outlet. Both types of yields are related to each other, and they are always positive.</p>
<p>The rates of the reactions that take place will vary with time in a batch reactor because the composition, and perhaps the temperature, will vary with time. Therefore, the instantaneous yield for a batch reactor will not necessarily be the same as the overall yield. Similarly, for a PFR, the composition and temperature will vary from point to point, so the overall yield will, if necessary, be the same as the instantaneous yield.</p>
<p>In contrast, for a CSTR, the overall and instantaneous yields are equal. As a consequence, the fluid composition and temperature do not vary inside the reactor.</p>
<p>There is a third parameter called <strong>global yield</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(\eta_P\)</span>, that frequently is used to describe the behavior of system in which more than one reaction takes place. The <strong>global yield</strong> is defined as
<span class="math display" id="eq:ec002074">\[\begin{equation}
  \eta_{P} = \frac{\text{All moles of P formed}}{\text{All moles of A fed}} = \frac{N_P - N_{P0}}{N_{A0}}
\tag{2.114}
\end{equation}\]</span>
The definitions of overall and global yield are similar. However, the last one is based on the amount of reactant that is <em>fed</em>.</p>
<p>The sum of all global yield of all products will not equal to unity as long as some <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> remains unconverted. The global and overall yield is related through the fractional conversion.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\text{moles of P formed}}{\text{moles of A fed}} = \frac{\text{moles of A reacted}}{\text{moles of A fed}} \times \frac{\text{moles of P formed}}{\text{moles of A reacted}} 
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ec002075">\[\begin{equation}
  \eta_{P} = X_A \, \widetilde{Y}_P
\tag{2.115}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(X_A\)</span> is the fractional conversion of reactant <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Or in differential mode
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  d\eta_{P} = d\left(X_A \, \widetilde{Y}_P\right) = Y_P \: dX_A
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In case there is no product <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> present in the reactor feed, the <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> of the reaction mixture is constant over the entire reactor, the stoichiometric coefficients of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in the reaction equation are equal, the defining equations above simplify to
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  \widetilde{Y}_P &amp;= \frac{C_P}{C_{A0} - C_A} \\
  \eta_P &amp;= \frac{C_P}{C_{A0}}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>For convenient reasons, it could be rather to use a selectivity ratio instead of yield. Thus, the parameter <strong>instantaneous selectivity</strong> is defined as the ratio of reaction rate of the desired product <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to the reaction rate of the undesired product <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.
<span class="math display" id="eq:eq076">\[\begin{equation}
    S_{PX} = \frac{r_P}{r_X} = \frac{k_p\,{C_{A}}^m}{k_x\,{C_A}^n}
\tag{2.116}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>There are other definitions of selectivity, for example, the formation of the desired product divided by the formation of all products, all based on moles.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  S_{P} = \frac{\text{All moles of P formed}}{\text{All moles of all products formed}}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>Another useful quantity is the <strong>Rate of Production</strong> of a given product <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. We mean the amount of desired product produced by the reactor per unit time <span class="math inline">\(F_P\)</span>, usually in moles/time. If specie <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the reactant and specie <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the desired product, then
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  F_P = \widetilde{Y}_P\:F_{A0} = S_Px\:X_A\:F_{A0}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>It is difficult to develop general guidelines regarding selecting and designing a reactor for a consecutive parallel reaction network than for a parallel-reaction or consecutive-reaction network separately. It is necessary to analyze various factors related to the particular situation considered. A list of steps is as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A kinetics analysis.</li>
<li>A stoichiometric analysis to determine the maximum number of independent material balance equations and kinetics rate laws required.</li>
<li>A material balance analysis.</li>
<li>Selection of an appropriate numerical scheme to be used to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Calculation of selectivity, yield, or production rate concerning the reactor’s size and type/configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p>Qualitatively, let us analyze the following competitive reactions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    &amp; a_1A + b_1B \xrightarrow[]{k_1} p_1P, \quad r_1 = k_1\,C_A^{\alpha_{1,A}}\,C_B^{\alpha_{1,B}} \\
    &amp;a_2A + b_2B \xrightarrow[]{k_2}s_2S, \quad r_2 = k_2\,C_A^{\alpha_{2,A}}\,C_B^{\alpha_{2,B}}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The instantaneous yield of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  Y_P &amp; = \frac{r_P}{-r_A} = \frac{p_1\,r_1}{a_1\,r_1 + a_2\,r_2} = \cfrac{\cfrac{p_1}{a_1}}{1+\cfrac{a_2\,r_2}{a_1\,r_1}} \\
      &amp; = \cfrac{\cfrac{p_1}{a_1}}{1+\cfrac{a_2\,k_2}{a_1\,k_1}C_A^{\left(\alpha_{2,A} - \alpha_{1,A}\right)}\,C_B^{\left(\alpha_{2,B} - \alpha_{1,B}\right)}}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The maximum value of instantaneous yield will be
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
Y_{P,\text{max}} = \frac{p_1}{a_1}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, a normalized yield would be
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \frac{Y_P}{Y_{P,\text{max}}} = \cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{a_2\,k_2}{a_1\,k_1}C_A^{\left(\alpha_{2,A} - \alpha_{1,A}\right)}\,C_B^{\left(\alpha_{2,B} - \alpha_{1,B}\right)}}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>Based on the previous equation, maximizing the value of yield implies:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{2,A} &lt; \alpha_{1,A}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{2,B} &lt; \alpha_{1,B}\)</span>, keep <span class="math inline">\(C_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_B\)</span> as high as possible, so PFR is better than CSTR.</li>
<li>if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{2,A} = \alpha_{1,A}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{2,B} &lt; \alpha_{1,B}\)</span>, keep <span class="math inline">\(C_B\)</span> as high as possible, so PFR is better than CSTR.</li>
<li>if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{2,A} = \alpha_{1,A}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{2,B} &gt; \alpha_{1,B}\)</span>, keep <span class="math inline">\(C_B\)</span> as low as possible, so CSTR is better than PFR.</li>
