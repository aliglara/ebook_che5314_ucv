Lara 2022-07-29 Introduction This is an online book written in Markdown and LaTeX where I published the personal notes that I used to use while I was lecturing Chemical Reactor Design at the Central University of Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela. Because it is an informal recompilation of my notes, this material is not a comprehensive book where you will find details in concepts of the area. However, it is a relatively straightforward guide for an intermediate undergraduate student of Chemical Engineering who has taken an introductory course on Chemical reaction kinetics. Besides concepts and mathematical deductions, I added typical problems solved in Python. Most of the illustrations given are modifications of examples taken from classic textbooks like Fogler or Roberts.
