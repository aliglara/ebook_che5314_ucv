Lara 2021-02-18 Introduction This is an online book written in Markdown and LaTeX where I published the personal notes that I used to use while I was lecturing Chemical Reactor Design at the Central University of Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela. Because it is an informal recompilation of my notes, this material is not a comprehensive book where you will find details in concepts of the area. However, it is a relatively straightforward guide for an intermediate undergraduate student of Chemical Engineering who has taken an introductory course on Chemical reaction kinetics. Besides concepts and mathematical deductions, I added typical problems solved in Python. Most of the illustrations given are modifications of examples taken from classic textbooks like Fogler or Roberts.

However, the prediction on heterogeneous systems is more complicated because of the effect of mass and heat transfer rate over the reaction rate. 1.1 Fundamental of Kinetics and Reaction Equilibrium It is essential to review some definitions related to design a chemical reactor before starting with our main subject. The first one is reaction rate. For a homogeneous reaction, the reaction rate is defined either as the amount of product formed or the amount of reactant consumed per unit volume of the liquid or gas phase per unit time. \\[\\begin{equation*} r \\equiv \\frac{\\text{moles consumed or produced}}{\\text{reactor volume} \\times \\text{time}} \\end{equation*}\\] The reaction rate is based on moles of reactant consumed or produced per unit mass of catalyst per unit time for solid-catalyzed reactions. \\[\\begin{equation*} r \\equiv \\frac{\\text{moles consumed or produced}}{\\text{mass of catalyst} \\times \\text{time}} \\end{equation*}\\] The second important is conversion, \\(X\\), which is defined as the fraction of the more critical or limiting reactant consumed. \\[\\begin{equation*} X_A \\equiv \\frac{\\text{moles A reacted}}{\\text{moles of A fed}} \\end{equation*}\\] The yield is the quantity created by the desired product compared to the quantity that would have been generated if there were no by-products and the primary reaction was completed. \\[\\begin{equation*} Y \\equiv \\frac{\\text{moles of product formed}}{\\text{maximum moles of product},\\,X=1.0} \\end{equation*}\\] For \\(nA \\rightarrow B\\) \\[\\begin{equation*} Y \\equiv \\frac{F_B}{F_A/n} \\end{equation*}\\] Finally, the selectivity is the amount of desired product divided by the amount of reactant consumed. This ratio often changes as the reaction progresses, and the selectivity based on the final mixture composition should be called an average selectivity. For \\(nA \\rightarrow B\\) \\[\\begin{equation*} \\overline{S} = \\frac{\\text{B formed}}{\\text{A used}} = \\frac{F_B}{F_A\\,X_A/n} = \\frac{Y}{X_A} \\end{equation*}\\] 1.1.1 Power-Law Kinetics 1.1.1.1 Irreversible Reaction For an irreversible reaction where two reactants forming a product \\[\\begin{equation*} A + B \\rightarrow C \\end{equation*}\\] The overall reaction rate \\(r\\) can be expressed as the moles of components A being consumed per unit time per unit volume. Additionally, the overall reaction rate has a temperature dependence governed by the specific reaction rate \\(k(T)\\) and a concentration dependence. In terms of molar concentrations for components \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the overall rate reaction could be expressed as: \\[\\begin{equation*} r = k(T)\\,C_A^\\alpha\\,C_B^\\beta \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are the order of reaction for each reactants. The actual reaction mechanism determines the form of the kinetic expression. More than one mechanism may provide the same expression of the rate. Only in elementary reaction steps the reaction order equal to the stoichiometry. The temperature-dependent specific reaction \\(k(T)\\) is represented by Arrhenius equation \\[\\begin{equation*} k(T) = k_0(T) \\exp\\left[{\\left(-E/R/T\\right)}\\right] \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(k_0(T)\\) is the pre-exponential factor, usually a big positive number that has units with respect to each component based on the concentration units and the order of the reaction, \\(E\\) is the activation energy, \\(R\\) is the universal gas-constant, and \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature. If \\(n = \\alpha + \\beta\\) then \\[\\begin{equation*} k(T) = \\frac{\\left[\\text{Concentration}^{\\left(1-n\\right)}\\right]}{\\text{time}} \\end{equation*}\\] It is essential to know that: If temperature increase the \\(k_0(T)\\) will be increased. \\(k_0(T)\\) will be more sensitive to temperature changes at higher activation energy. 1.1.1.2 Reversible Reaction Consider next reversible reaction The forward rate reaction in terms of molar concentrations of reactants A and B will be: \\[\\begin{gather*} r_f = k_f(T)\\,C_A^\\alpha\\,C_B^\\beta \\\\ k_f(T) = k_{0_f}(T) \\exp{\\left(-E_f/R/T\\right)} \\end{gather*}\\] The reverse rate reaction will be: \\[\\begin{gather*} r_r = k_r(T)\\,C_C^\\gamma\\\\ k_r(T) = k_{0_r}(T) \\exp{\\left(-E_R/R/T\\right)} \\end{gather*}\\] The net overall rate reaction will be: \\[\\begin{equation*} r = r_F - r_R = k_F(T)\\,C_A^\\alpha\\,C_B^\\beta - k_R(T)\\,C_C^\\gamma \\end{equation*}\\] Under chemical equilibrium conditions, the net overall rate reaction is equal to zero, which leads to: \\[\\begin{gather*} K_\\text{eq} = \\frac{k_f(T)}{k_r(T)} = \\frac{C_A^\\alpha\\,C_B^\\beta}{C_C^\\gamma} \\\\ K_\\text{eq} = \\frac{k_{0_r}(T) \\exp{\\left(-E_r/R/T\\right)}}{k_{0_r}(T) \\exp{\\left(-E_r/R/T\\right)}} = \\frac{k_{0_f}}{k_{0_r}}\\,\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_r-E_f}{RT}\\right) \\end{gather*}\\] It is important to know that: If \\(E_R = E_F\\), then \\(K_\\text{eq}\\) is independent of temperature If \\(E_R &gt; E_F\\), then the process is exothermic, so if temperature increases, then the exponential factor decreases and \\(K_\\text{eq}\\) decreases. If \\(E_R &lt; E_F\\), then the process is endothermic (energy is required in order to transform reactants into products), so if temperature increases, then the exponential factor increases, and \\(K_\\text{eq}\\) increases. The van’t Hoff equation of thermodynamics gives the temperature dependence of the chemical equilibrium constant. \\[\\begin{gather*} \\frac{d\\,\\ln K_\\text{eq}}{d\\,T} = \\frac{\\Delta H_R^\\circ (T)}{R\\,T^2} \\\\ \\Delta H_R^\\circ(T) = E_f - E_r \\end{gather*}\\] 1.1.2 Multiple Reactions In a reacting system might occur more than one chemical reaction. We are frequently interested in just one called the principal, while others are side-reactions. The latter produce undesired components that diminish the yield of the desired product. 1.1.2.1 Parallel Reactions In this case, the reactants form other undesired products in parallel with the primary reaction. For example: If we assume first-order kinetics, the reactions occur in a simple batch isothermal reactor at volume constant. The concentrations of each component could be express as: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d\\,C_A}{dt} &amp;= -\\left(k_B+k_C\\right)\\,C_A \\\\ \\frac{d\\,C_B}{dt} &amp;= k_B\\,C_A \\\\ \\frac{d\\,C_C}{dt} &amp;= k_C\\,C_A \\end{align*}\\] If at \\(t=0\\), \\(C_A = C_{A0}\\), \\(C_B=0\\) and \\(C_C = 0\\) then \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{C_A}{C_{A0}} &amp;= e^{-\\left(k_B+k_C\\right)\\,t} \\\\ \\frac{C_B}{C_{A0}} &amp;= \\frac{k_B}{k_B+k_C}\\,\\left(1-e^{-\\left(k_B+k_C\\right)\\,t} \\right)\\\\ \\frac{C_C}{C_{A0}} &amp;= \\frac{k_C}{k_B+k_C}\\,\\left(1-e^{-\\left(k_B+k_C\\right)\\,t} \\right) \\end{align*}\\] From scypi.integrate, we can use the function solve_ivp to solve ODEs using several Runge-Kutta’s methods. solution = solve_ivp(fun, (0, tfin), c0, t_eval=np.linspace(0, tfin, 100)) The graphical solution for this sample is available (file). Figure 1.1: Concentrations vs time for parallel reactions. In figure 1.1, we could see that more product B is generated at higher \\(k_B\\) values concerning \\(k_C\\). This behavior is represented in terms of the Selectivity (S) to the desired product: \\[\\begin{equation*} S =\\frac{C_B}{C_C} \\end{equation*}\\] Our job as engineers is to optimize the reactor’s operation, so in this case, we must find the best operating temperature to maximize selectivity. In the case the reactor has more than one reactant, the selectivity is affected by their concentrations. 1.1.2.2 Series Reactions For series reactions, an intermediate is formed that can then further react. For a reaction system: The reactions in standard form are: For a batch reactor, the mass balances on A, B, and C are: \\(A \\xrightarrow{k_B} B \\xrightarrow{k_C} C\\) The reactions in standard form are: \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; A \\xrightarrow{k_B} B &amp;&amp; r_1 = k_B\\,C_A \\\\ &amp; B \\xrightarrow{k_C} C &amp;&amp; r_2 = k_C\\,C_B \\end{align*}\\] For a batch reactor, the mass balances on A, B, and C are: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d\\,C_A}{dt} &amp;= -k_B\\,C_A \\\\ \\frac{d\\,C_B}{dt} &amp;= k_B\\,C_A - k_C\\,C_C\\\\ \\frac{d\\,C_C}{dt} &amp;= k_C\\,C_B \\end{align*}\\] If at \\(t=0\\), \\(C_A = C_{A0}\\), \\(C_B=0\\) and \\(C_C = 0\\) then \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{C_A}{C_{A0}} &amp;= e^{-k_B\\,t} \\\\ \\frac{C_B}{C_{A0}} &amp;= \\frac{k_B}{k_C-k_B}\\,\\left(e^{-k_B\\,t} - e^{-k_C\\,t} \\right)\\\\ \\frac{C_C}{C_{A0}} &amp;= 1 -\\frac{C_A(t)}{C_{A0}} -\\frac{C_B(t)}{C_{A0}} \\end{align*}\\] The graphical solution for this sample is available (file). Figure 1.2: Concentrations vs time for series reactions. The figure 1.2 shows typical composition profiles. And on the \\(C_B\\) profile, we notice that there is a peak at some point in time. Therefore, the batch should be stopped at that time to maximize selectivity. 1.2 Temperature effects over chemical kinetics Temperature changes affect the reaction rate, and hence the mode of reactor operation in two ways: temperature dependence of (1) the rate parameters and (2) the equilibrium constant. Several kinds of behavior occur, some of which are represented in fig. @ref(fig:temperature_effect). The temperature dependence of reactions rate constants will meet the Arrhenius law where A is the pre-exponential factor and E is the activation energy. Figure 1.3: Typical Arrehnius plot Whereas the exponential dependence of rate constants on temperature means that the reaction rate changes rapidly as temperature changes. Moreover, the larger the value of activation energy, the more significant the reaction rate difference for a given temperature change. The temperature dependence of the chemical equilibrium constant (\\(K\\)) is given by the van’t Hoff equation. \\[\\begin{equation*} \\frac{d\\, \\ln K}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_R}{R\\,T^2} \\end{equation*}\\] Thus for an exothermic reaction, an increase in temperature decreases the equilibrium yield and vice-versa. Figure 1.4: Effect of temperature on reaction rate (Walas 1989) In Figure 1.4, (a) Normal behavior, kinetic rate increases rapidly with rising temperature. (b) The behavior of particular heterogeneous reactions dominated by resistance to diffusion between phases. (c) Typical explosions, where the rapid rise takes place at the ignition temperature. (d) Catalytic reactions are controlled by the rate of adsorption (in which the amount of adsorption decreases at elevated temperatures) and enzyme reactions (where high temperatures destroy the enzyme). (e) Some reactions, such as oxidation of carbon, are complicated by side reaction, which becomes significant as the temperature rises. (f) Diminishing rate with increasing temperature, for example, the reaction between oxygen and nitric oxide where the equilibrium conversion is favored by lower temperatures. The rates appear to depend on the displacement from equilibrium. The values of the heat of reaction \\(\\Delta H_{R,j}(T)\\) must be known, which must be calculated from \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Delta H_R (T^\\circ) = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\Delta H_{fi}^\\circ \\end{equation*}\\] where the superscript ``\\(^\\circ\\)’’ denotes the standard conditions. Except in unusual cases, e.g., reactions at supercritical conditions, a temperature correction is the only thing that is necessary to calculate the value of \\(\\Delta H_{R}(T)\\) from \\(\\Delta H_R (T^\\circ)\\) using, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Delta H_{R}(T) = \\Delta H_R(T^\\circ) + \\int_{T^\\circ}^T \\nu_i C_{Pi}\\,dT \\end{equation*}\\] Which equation is valid on the assumption that no phase change takes place between \\(T^\\circ\\) and \\(T\\) 1.3 Equation rate when density of fluid is variable Changes in the volume yield a difference in concentrations. For example, let us consider the following reaction is taking place in a gas-phase. \\[\\begin{equation} A + \\frac{b}{a} B \\xrightarrow{k} \\frac{c}{a}C + \\frac{d}{a}D \\end{equation}\\] At any time, and at any point inside the reactor, it is known that: \\[\\begin{equation} P\\,V = Z\\,R\\, n\\,T \\end{equation}\\] Therefore, it is possible to correlate the volume \\(V\\) at \\(t = 0\\) with any \\(t = t\\) by \\[\\begin{equation} V = V_0 \\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\frac{T}{T_0}\\,\\left(\\frac{Z}{Z_0}\\right)\\,\\frac{n_T}{n_{T0}} \\end{equation}\\] The stoichiometric coefficients in reaction represent the increase in the total number of moles per mole of A reacted by symbol \\(\\delta\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\delta = \\frac{d}{a} + \\frac{c}{a} - \\frac{b}{a} - 1 \\end{equation}\\] Therefore, using this parameter \\(\\delta\\) is possible to calculate the total of moles (\\(n\\)) at any time t by \\[\\begin{equation} n = n_0 + \\delta \\, n_{A0} \\, X_A \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n_0\\) represents the total moles at \\(t = 0\\), \\(N_{A0}\\) initial moles of \\(A\\) and \\(X\\) is the fractional conversion of \\(A\\). Combining this relationship with the previous volume equation \\[\\begin{equation} V = V_0 \\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\frac{T}{T_0}\\,\\left(\\frac{Z}{Z_0}\\right)\\,\\left(1 + \\varepsilon_A\\,X_A\\right) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\varepsilon_A = \\delta \\, y_{A0}\\) and it represents the change in the total number of moles for complete conversion to the total number of moles fed to the reactor. The concentrations to be substituted into the rate equation can be expressed as \\[\\begin{equation} C_A = \\frac{N_A}{V} = \\frac{N_{A0}}{V_0} \\frac{\\left(1-X_A\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\varepsilon_A\\,X\\right)} \\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\frac{T}{T_0}\\,\\left(\\frac{Z}{Z_0}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] and in terms of the partial pressures, \\[\\begin{align} P_A &amp; = P \\,\\frac{N_A}{N} = P\\,\\frac{N_{A0}}{N_0} \\frac{\\left(1-X_A\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\varepsilon_A\\,X\\right)} \\\\ \\notag &amp; = P_{A0}\\,\\frac{\\left(1-X_A\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\varepsilon_A\\,X\\right)}\\left( \\frac{P}{P_0} \\right) \\end{align}\\] When a reactor operates under isothermal conditions, and the pressure drop is neglected, thus \\[\\begin{equation} V = V_0 \\left(1 + \\varepsilon_A\\,X_A \\right) \\end{equation}\\] 1.4 Ideal Reactors Industrial chemical reactors can be large and complex pieces of equipment. However, many of these reactors can be modeled with reasonable accuracy using an ideal reactor model. There are two types of ideal reactors, stirred tanks for liquids’ reactions and tubular for gas or liquid reactions. Stirred-tank reactors include batch reactor, semi-batch reactor, and continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs). The criterion for ideality in-tank reactors is that the liquid is perfectly mixed, which means no gradients in the vessel’s temperature or concentration. Tubular reactors are considered ideal if there is a plug flow of fluid. There are no radial gradients of concentration or velocity, nor is there no axial diffusion or conduction. Although these ideal conditions are impossible to reach into real industrial reactors, the classical idealizations can be used for studying both steady-state design and the dynamic control of chemical reactors. In this class, we discuss the classical types of reactors qualitatively: batch reactor (BR), continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSRT), plug flow reactor (PFR). "],["ideal-chemical-reactor-design.html", "Chapter 2 Ideal Chemical Reactor Design 2.1 Material Balance 2.2 Energy Balance 2.3 Momentum Balance 2.4 The Continuous-Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR)", " Chapter 2 Ideal Chemical Reactor Design Process design has to do with specific matters relating to the process itself, in our cases, such as operation conditions, size, configuration, and operation mode of the reactor. Figure 2.1: Conceptual Map of Chemical Reactor Design In this course, we will focus on the phenomena taking place in basic reactor types. The phenomena occurring in a reactor may be broken down into reaction, mass, heat, and momentum transfer. Therefore, reactors’ modeling and design are based on the reaction rate equation, the continuity, energy, and momentum equations. The modeling and design of reactors are based on the equations describing these phenomena: the reaction rate equation and the continuity, energy, and momentum equations (Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011). Additionally, we will study two situations (1) the design of a new chemical reactor for a new process, (2) the analysis of the performance of an existing reactor for a current process. In many cases, as chemical engineers, we must consider several items shown in figure 2.1 when starts the design or analysis of a reactor. 2.1 Material Balance As a chemical engineer, our main modeling tools are the material balance and energy balance. We should remember two aspects: the material balance of a reactor must consider the rate at which species are converted from one chemical form to another and the rate at which energy is transformed by the process. We will perform a mole balance on species \\(j\\) in a system volume, where \\(j\\) represents the particular chemical species of interest. Figure 2.2: System volume scheme Based on figure 2.2, the mole balance expressed in mole/time would be \\[\\begin{equation} F_{j0} + G_j - {F_j } = \\frac{dN_j}{dt} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(F_{j0}\\) is rate flow in \\(j\\), \\(G_j\\) is the generation rate of \\(j\\) by chemical reaction, \\(F_{j}\\) is rate flow out \\(j\\), and \\(dN_j/dt\\) means accumulation rate of \\(j\\). In equation (2.1), the generation/consumption of \\(j\\) (\\(G_j\\)) will be expressed as the product of the reaction volume, \\(V\\), and the rate of reaction, \\(r\\). The symbol \\(r\\) is expressed in molar units per unit time and volume, and it is always positive when the reaction proceeds in the direction of the arrow. Thus, the integral form of the general mole balance for any chemical specie \\(j\\) yields. \\[\\begin{equation} F_{j0} - F_j + \\int_{0}^V {r_j\\,dV} = \\frac{dN_j}{dt} \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] In mathematical terms, the equation (2.2) is called the continuity equation for \\(j\\). If \\(j\\) reacts in more than one phase, such an equation is needed for each phase. This equation will develop the design equations for different ideal reactors: batch, semi-batch, and continuous-flow. The mechanisms by which \\(j\\) can enter or leave the volume element are flow and molecular diffusion, and they are irrelevant. However, it is essential to realize that a fluid’s motion is not really ordered and challenging to describe. For this reason, as a first approach, it is therefore natural to consider two extreme conceptual cases: first, where there is no mixing of the streamlines, and second, where the mixing is complete. These two extremes may be formulated with sufficient approximation by the tubular plug flow reactor, and the continuous flow stirred tank with complete mixing. In a plug flow reactor, all fluids elements move with equal velocity along parallel streamlines. The plug flow is the only mechanism for mass transport, and there is no mixing between fluid elements. The reaction leads to a concentration gradient in the axial flow direction. Reactors with complete mixing may be subdivided into batch and continuous types. In batch-reactor types with complete mixing, the composition is uniform throughout the reactor. Consequently, the continuity equations may be written for the entire contents, not over a volume element. As the bulk composition varies with time, a first-order ordinary differential equation is obtained, with time as a variable. The form of this equation is analogous to that for the plug flow case. In the continuous flow type, an element of the entering fluid is instantaneously mixed with the reactor’s contents so that it loses its identity. This type also operates at a constant concentration level. In the steady-state, the continuity equations are algebraic. Both types of continuous reactors considered are idealized conceptual cases. They are important cases because they are easy to calculate and give the extreme values of the conversions between those realized in a real reactor. With its intermediate level of mixing, the design of a real reactor requires information about this mixing.(Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011) 2.2 Energy Balance The real chemical reactors are almost operated under nonisothermal conditions because reactions generate or absorb large amounts of heat. Detailed reactor sizing and analysis require the energy balance to be solved in conjunction with one or more material balances. For a generic open system, the energy balance is: \\[\\begin{equation*} Q - {W_s} + \\dot{H}_\\text{in} - \\dot{H}_\\text{out} = \\frac{dE}{dt} \\end{equation*}\\] The terms in energy balances have the following meanings: \\(Q\\) is the rate of heat transfer into the reactor. \\(W_s\\) means the rate at which shaft work is done by the system on the surrounding. If shaft work is done on the contents of the reactor, e.g., by an agitator, the value of \\(W_s\\) is negative. \\(\\dot{H}_\\text{in}\\) is the rate at which enthalpy is transported into the reactor. \\(\\dot{H}_\\text{out}\\) is the rate at which enthalpy is transported out of the reactor. \\(dE/dt\\) is the rate at which the system’s total energy, \\(E\\), changes with time. In chemical reactors, it is typically assumed the internal energy is the dominant contribution over the kinetic and potential energies. Thus, the general energy balance will be \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dU}{dt}= Q - W_s + \\dot{H}_{\\text{in}} - \\dot{H}_\\text{out} \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] For single reactors, the inlet and outlet molar flow are related through the extents of reaction (\\(\\xi\\)). If “\\(R\\)” independent reactions occur, and if the extents of reaction are zero in the stream that enters the reactor.(Roberts 2009) \\[\\begin{equation*} F_i - F_{i0} = {\\sum}_{j=1}^{R} \\nu_{j,i}\\,\\xi_j \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(\\nu_{j,i}\\) refers to stoichiometric coefficient of the component in the reaction . Therefore, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\dot{H}_{\\text{in}} - \\dot{H}_{\\text{out}} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\\,\\overline{H}_{i0} - {{\\sum_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C}}} \\left(F_{i0} + \\sum_{j=1}^{R} \\nu_{j,i}\\,\\xi_j\\right)\\,\\overline{H}_i \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(\\overline H_i\\) refers to the partial molar enthalpy of the component . Assuming that feed and product streams are ideal solutions, the partial molar enthalpies \\(\\overline{H}_i\\) can be replaced by pure component enthalpies, \\(H_i\\), Thus, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\dot{H}_{\\text{in}} - \\dot{H}_{\\text{out}} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\\,\\left({H}_{i0} - H_i\\right) - {{\\sum_{j=1}^R}} \\xi_j\\,\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathcal{C}} \\nu_{i,j}\\,{H}_i (T)\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] The term \\(\\sum \\nu_{i,j}\\,{H}^\\circ_i\\) is just the enthalpy of reaction for reaction \\(j\\), evaluated at exit conditions. Since the temperature of the effluent stream is \\(T\\), \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathcal{C}} \\nu_{i,j}\\,{H}_i = \\Delta H_{R,j}(T) \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(\\Delta H_{R_j}(T)\\) is the heat of reaction \\(j\\), evaluated at the temperature \\(T\\). If the pressure difference between the feed and the product streams is not substancial, and if there are no phase changes \\[\\begin{equation*} H_{i0} - H_i = \\int_T^{T_0} {C_{P_i}\\,dT} \\approx \\overline{C}_{P_i} \\left(T_0 - T\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] where, \\(T_0\\) is the temperature of the inlet stream, \\(C_{P_i}\\) is the constant-pressure molar heat capacity of specie i, and \\(\\overline{C}_{P_i}\\) is the average constant-pressure molar heat capacity over the temperature range \\(T_0\\) to \\(T\\) So, eq. (2.3) becomes to \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dU}{dt}= Q - W_s - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} \\left(F_{i0}\\,\\int_{T_0}^{T} {C_{P_i}\\,dT}\\right) - {\\sum_{j=1}^R} \\xi_j\\,\\Delta H_{R,j}(T) \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] Equation (2.4) is the energy balance for a whole reactor in which multiple reactions are taken place. In this equation, the term \\(\\left(\\sum F_{i0}\\,\\int{C_{P_i}\\,dT}\\right)\\) represents the rate of sensible heat, and it is usually written on a molar basis. The term \\(\\sum \\xi_j\\,\\Delta H_{R,j}(T)\\)), means the heat rate (generated or consumed) related to the reaction.(Roberts 2009) If only one reaction is taking place, eq. (2.4) can be written in terms of the fractional conversion. For a single reaction, where \\(A\\) is a reactant, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\xi = - \\frac{F_{A0} - F_A}{\\nu_A} = - \\frac{F_{A0}\\,X_A}{\\nu_A} \\end{equation*}\\] Substituting this relationship into eq. (2.4) and assuming steady-state condition gives (Roberts 2009) \\[\\begin{equation} Q - W_s - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} \\left(F_{i0}\\,\\int_{T_0}^{T} {C_{P_i}\\,dT}\\right) + F_{A0}\\,X_A\\,\\frac{\\Delta H_{R}(T)}{\\nu_A} = 0 \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation*} Q - W_s - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} \\left(F_{i0}\\,\\int_{T_0}^{T} {C_{P_i}\\,dT}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta H_{R}(T)}{\\nu_A}\\,r_A V =0 \\end{equation*}\\] When \\(\\nu_A = −1\\) is chosen, the basis for \\(\\Delta H_R\\) has been fixed to 1 mole of A, i.e., the units of \\(\\Delta H_R\\) must be energy/mole of A The form of the energy balance results from considerations closely related to those for different continuity equations. When the mixing is so intense that the concentration is uniform over the reactor, it may be accepted that the temperature is also uniform. When plug flow is postulated, it is natural to accept that the concentration in a section perpendicular to flow is considered to be uniform. It is natural to also consider the temperature to be uniform in this section. It follows that when the heat is exchanged with the surroundings, the temperature gradient has to be situated entirely in a thin “film” along the wall. This also implies that the resistance to heat transfer in the central core is zero in a direction perpendicular to the flow, which is not right for certain catalytic reactors. 2.3 Momentum Balance The momentum balance can be obtained by the application of Newton’s second law on a moving fluid. In a chemical reactor, only pressure drop and friction forces have to be considered in most cases. Several specific pressure drop equations will be discussed later on PFR and on a fixed catalytic reactor. 2.4 The Continuous-Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR) When the demand for a single chemical product reaches a high level, there will be an economic incentive to continuously manufacture it, using a reactor dedicated to that product. One of those is The Continuous-Stirred-Tank Reactor or CSTR. The CSTR is a well-mixed vessel consisting of a baffled tank with mixing induced by an impeller and operates at a steady-state. The mass flow rate into the tank is equal to the mass flow rate out of it at steady-state, and the feed and product properties are not functions of time. Furthermore, the reactor volume is constant. A well-mixed vessel means a working fluid with neither radial, axial, nor angular gradients in properties. In other words, both the composition and temperature of the fluid are uniform over the entire volume. That is, they do not vary with position. Those assumptions are The central assumption is that the incoming fluid concentration will become instantaneously equal to outgoing upon entering the vessel. As a consequence of well-mixing behavior, the effluent stream must have precisely the same composition and temperature as the contents of the reactor. The feed must be immediately mixed with the reactor’s contents in a time interval that is very small compared to the mean residence time of the fluid flowing through the vessel to meet this ideal mixing pattern. (Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011) The CSTR is frequently chosen when temperature control is a critical aspect when the conversion must occur at constant composition, when a reaction between two phases has to be carried out, or when a catalyst must be kept in suspension. (Froment, Bischoff, and De Wilde 2011) In practice, it is possible to reach a perfect mixing condition if the mixing time is much less than the residence time inside the reactor, usually when the fluid is low viscosity. 2.4.1 The design equation for a CSTR An ideal CSTR is quite similar to a perfectly mixed batch reactor. The most significant difference is that mass flows into and out of a CSTR. Thus, the mass flow in and out of the reactor in eq. (2.1) will not cancel. Writing the material balance for this system: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dN_j}{dt} = F_{\\text{in},j} - F_{j} + r_j V \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(F_{\\text{in},j}\\) is the molar flow in of \\(j\\), \\(F_{j}\\)is the molar flow out of \\(j\\), \\(V\\) is the reactor volume, \\(r_{j}\\) is the production rate of specie \\(j\\), and \\(N_{j}\\) means the number of moles of specie \\(j\\) At steady-state, the left-hand side of eq. (2.6) is zero, thus \\[\\begin{gather} F_{\\text{in},j} - F_{j} + r_j V = 0 \\notag \\\\ V = \\frac{F_{\\text{in},j} - F_{j}}{- r_j} \\tag{2.7} \\end{gather}\\] Equation (2.7) is the design equation for an ideal CSTR. For a single reaction, it is useful to write it down in terms of the conversion of reactant A. \\[\\begin{align*} F_{A,\\text{in}} &amp; = F_{A0} {\\left(1 - X_{A,\\text{in}} \\right) }\\\\ F_{A} &amp; = F_{A0} {\\left(1 - X_{A} \\right)} \\end{align*}\\] leading to \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{V}{F_{A0}} = \\frac{X_{A} - X_{A,\\text{in}}}{-r_A}, \\quad r_A = - r \\tag{2.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\nu_A\\) represents moles of A, and \\(r\\) the global rate equation. The material balance equation is usually solved for V in steady-state operation or determines the changes of outlet properties concerning time in the unsteady-state process for a particular V. These characteristics of a CSTR generates an inherent weakness in its operation related to the fractional conversion: \\[\\begin{equation*} X_A = \\frac{C_{A0} - C_A}{C_{A0}} \\end{equation*}\\] If a high conversion is desired, the reactant concentration must be small. But the reaction rate depends directly on the reactant concentration, so to compensate for this restriction, we must design larger reactors. 2.4.1.1 Constant-Density System If the reactor volume is constant and the volumetric flow rate of the inflow and outflow streams are the same, the eq. (2.6) in terms of volumetric flow rates, is \\[\\begin{gather} F_j = \\upsilon \\,C_j \\notag \\\\ \\frac{dC_j}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\overline t}\\left(C_{j,0} - C_{j} \\right)+ r_j \\tag{2.9} \\end{gather}\\] where \\(C_{0,j}\\) is the concentration of specie \\(j\\) at initial conditions, \\(C_j\\) is the concentration into the reactor, and \\(\\overline t\\) is used to refer to the mean residence time, which is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\overline t = \\frac{V}{\\upsilon} \\tag{2.10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\upsilon\\) is the volumetric flow rate evaluated at exit conditions. For \\(X_{A,\\text{in}} = 0\\), the effluent volumetric flow rate can be related to inlet flow rate by \\[\\begin{equation} \\upsilon = \\upsilon_0 \\left( 1 + \\nu\\, X_A \\right) \\tag{2.11} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\upsilon_0\\) is the volumetric flow rate evaluated at entrance conditions, and \\(\\nu = \\sum\\nolimits_j \\nu_j\\) Since the volumetric flow rate is a function of \\(X\\), \\(T\\), and \\(P\\), the mean residence time, \\(\\overline t\\), depends on those variables. Instead of using the reactor residence time to describe performance, an equal quantity called space-time define as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tau = \\frac{V}{\\upsilon_0} \\tag{2.12} \\end{equation}\\] This definition of space-time applies to any continuous reactor. For a homogeneous reaction, space-time has the dimension of time. It is related to the average time a volume element of fluid spends in the reactor. Although space-time is not necessarily equal to the mean residence time, they behave similarly, and it is possible to relate eq. (2.10) and eq. (2.12) \\[\\begin{equation} \\overline t = \\frac{\\tau}{1 + \\varepsilon_A\\, X_A} \\tag{2.13} \\end{equation}\\] If the volume change in the reactor is negligible, then \\(\\varepsilon_A = 0\\). Finally, if the working fluid has constant density \\[\\begin{gather} V = \\frac{\\left(C_{A0} - C_A\\right) \\upsilon}{r_A} \\notag \\\\ \\overline t = \\tau \\tag{2.14} \\end{gather}\\] Space-time influences reaction behavior in a continuous reactor in the same way that real-time does on a batch reactor’s behavior. In both cases, the fractional conversion will increase if reactants spend more time or space-time increases. Therefore, if the fluid density is constant, eq. (2.8) becomes \\[\\begin{equation} \\tau = \\frac{C_{A0} - C_{A}}{-r_A}, \\quad r_A = - r \\end{equation}\\] The equation (2.8) may be interpreted graphically from a plot of reciprocal rate \\(1/(−r_A)\\) as function of \\(X_A\\), as shown by curve EB in fig. 2.3. Point B is the operating point of the reactor, which represents the steady-state condition in the reactor. Area ABCD represents the ratio \\(V/F_{A0}\\) for the CSTR. Figure 2.3: Graphical representation of the performance equations for CSTR Another parameter commonly used for CSTR design is the inverse of \\(\\tau\\), called space velocity, which can be regarded as the number of reactor volumes of feed processed per unit time at the feed conditions. \\[\\begin{gather} \\text{SV} = \\frac{\\upsilon_0}{V} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\tag{2.15} \\end{gather}\\] Space velocity is more useful in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Its definition is not unique. For example, it can also be defined as GHSV, which means gas-hourly space velocity. It may be defined as the volumetric flow rate of gas entering the catalyst divided by the catalyst’s weight. 2.4.1.2 Variable-Density System For variable-density cases, the design equation for a CSTR is: \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{V}{\\upsilon} = \\tau &amp; = \\frac{V}{\\upsilon_0 \\left( 1 + \\varepsilon_A\\, X_A \\right) } = \\frac{C_{A0} - C_A}{r_A(C_A)} \\notag \\\\ \\tau &amp; = \\left( 1 + \\varepsilon_A\\, X_A \\right)\\,\\frac{C_{A0} - C_A}{r_A(C_A)} \\end{align}\\] 2.4.2 CSTR in series CSTRs of equal sizes in series Consider a system of \\(N\\) CSTRs connected in series, as shown in the figure 2.4. Though the concentration is uniform in each reactor, there is a change in concentration as fluid moves from one reactor to another. Figure 2.4: Sketch of ideal CSTRs in series The feed molar flow rate of reactant A is \\(F_{A0}\\), the effluent conversion of A from the first reactor is \\(X_{A1}\\), while the output conversion of A from the second reactor is \\(X_{A2}\\) so on. It is crucial to be consistent in defining the fractional conversion for a series of reactors. For a series of three CSRTs in serie \\[\\begin{align*} X_{A,1} = \\left(F_{A0} - F_{A,1} \\right)/(F_{A0}) \\\\ X_{A,2} = \\left(F_{A0} - F_{A,2} \\right)/(F_{A0}) \\\\ X_{A,3} = \\left(F_{A0} - F_{A,3} \\right)/(F_{A0}) \\end{align*}\\] The conversion \\(X_{A1}\\) is the fractional conversion of A in the stream leaving the first reactor. In contrast, \\(X_A2\\) is the overall conversion of A in the second reactor’s effluent, which means the conversion for the first and second reactors combined. Thus, the overall conversion for the series of three CSTRs is equal to \\(X_{A3}\\). (Roberts 2009) The mole balance for reactant \\(A\\) can be written for any reactor \\(j\\) in the series will be \\[\\begin{equation} - r_{A,j} = \\frac{F_{A,j-1} - F_{A,j}}{V_j} \\end{equation}\\] The molar flow rates from a reactor \\(j\\) and \\(j-1\\) expressed in terms of conversion are: \\[\\begin{align*} F_{A,j-1} &amp; = F_{A0} {\\left(1 - X_{A,j-1} \\right) }\\\\ F_{A,j} &amp; = F_{A0} {\\left(1 - X_{A,j} \\right)} \\end{align*}\\] The change in the molar flow rate of A in any reactor is defined as \\[\\begin{equation*} F_{A,j-1} - F_{A,j} = F_{A0}\\left(X_{A,j} - X_{A,j-1}\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] Therefore, the design equation for a reactor \\(j\\) is written in terms of conversion as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{V_j}{F_{A0}}= \\frac{\\left(X_{A,j} - X_{A,j-1}\\right)}{- r_A\\left(X_{A,j}\\right)} \\tag{2.16} \\end{equation}\\] This equation can be rearranged in terms of the conversion from reactor \\(j\\) \\[\\begin{equation} X_{A,j} = X_{A,j-1} - \\frac{r_{A,j}\\:V_j}{F_{A0}} \\tag{2.17} \\end{equation}\\] Equation (2.17) can be solved for each reactor sequentially to calculate the incremental conversion from each reactor. Equation (2.18) can be generalized to apply to the Nth reactor in a series of CSTRs \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{ec:002_044d} \\frac{V_N}{F_{A0}}= \\frac{\\left(X_{A,N} - X_{A,N-1}\\right)}{- r_A\\left(X_{A,N}\\right)} \\tag{2.18} \\end{equation}\\] A typical case is to evaluate the behavior of a series of N equal-size CSTRs that operate isothermally, with a first-order kinetic and no volume change \\(\\left( \\upsilon = \\upsilon_0 \\right)\\). In this case, it is convenient to write mass balances on specie A in terms of concentrations and \\(\\tau\\) instead of fractional conversion. \\[\\begin{align*} C_{A0} - C_{A1} &amp;= \\tau_1\\,r (C_{A1}) \\\\ C_{A1} - C_{A2} &amp;= \\tau_2\\,r (C_{A2}) \\\\ C_{A2} - C_{A3} &amp;= \\tau_3\\,r (C_{A3}) \\\\ &amp;\\vdots \\\\ C_{A,n-1} - C_{An} &amp;= \\tau_n\\,r (C_{An}) \\end{align*}\\] Usually the initial concentration of A is known. Therefore, the system of equations can be rewritten as: \\[\\begin{align*} C_{A1} &amp;= \\frac{C_{A0}}{\\left( 1 + \\tau_1 k \\right)} \\\\ C_{A2} &amp;= \\frac{C_{A0}}{\\left( 1 + \\tau_1\\, k\\right)\\left( 1 + \\tau_2\\, k\\right)} \\\\ &amp;\\vdots \\\\ C_{Ai} &amp;= \\frac{C_{A(i-1)}}{\\left( 1 + \\tau_i\\, k\\right)} = \\frac{C_{A0}}{\\prod_k \\left( 1 + \\tau_k\\, k\\right)} \\end{align*}\\] In general, \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{C_{A,i-1}}{C_{A,i}} = 1 + k\\,\\tau_i \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad \\tau_i = \\frac{C_{A,i-1}-C_{A,i}}{k\\,C_{A,i}} \\tag{2.19} \\end{equation}\\] Assuming all reactors have the same volume (\\(V_i\\)), which means they have the same \\(\\tau\\), then the total residence time in the series of N equal-residence-time CSTR is equal \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{k} \\tau_{k} = N\\, \\tau\\) and \\(C_{A,N}\\), the concentration from the N-th reactor is given in terms of \\(C_{A0}\\) by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{C_{A,N}}{C_{A0}} = \\frac{C_{A,1}}{C_{A0}} \\frac{C_{A,2}}{C_{A,1}} \\cdots \\frac{C_{A,N-1}}{C_{A,N}} = \\frac{1}{{\\left( 1 + \\tau_N\\, k\\right)}^N} \\tag{2.20} \\end{equation}\\] Substituting for \\(C_{A,N}\\) in terms of conversion \\[\\begin{equation} C_{A0}\\:{\\left(1 - X_{A,N} \\right)} = \\frac{C_{A0}}{{\\left( 1 + \\tau_N\\, k \\right)}^N} \\Rightarrow X_{A,N} = 1 - \\frac{1}{{\\left( 1 + \\tau_N\\, k\\right)}^N} \\tag{2.21} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 2.5 shows the variation of conversion vs. the number of reactors in series for a first-order reaction. It also indicates that the Damkholer number is a crucial parameter to decide the optimal number of CSTRs required to reach an overall conversion. Figure 2.5: Plot of conversion as function of number of CSTRs in serie In general, while the Damkholer number increases, the system will require fewer CSTRs to get the desired level of conversion. (Numerical solution) The total capital cost is an important parameter rather than the total reactor volume in a practical situation. Increasing the number of CSTRs in series will reduce the total cost by reducing the required volume. However, it will also increase the price since more agitators, valves, piping, etc., will be required. The economic optimum usually occurs at a value of \\(N\\) as low as 2 or 3. (Roberts 2009) The optimal operation of a multistage CSTR can be considered from the point of view of minimizing the total volume V for a given throughput (\\(F_{A0}\\)) and fractional conversion (\\(X_A\\)). So it will be necessary an objective function for \\(V\\) from the material balance together with a rate law and energy balance as required CSTRs of different sizes in series For reactions with slight density change is possible to find the outlet composition from a series of CSTRs by a graphical procedure due to the design equation of each CSTRs could be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} -\\frac{1}{\\tau_N} = \\frac{(-r_A)_N}{C_{A,N} - C_{A,N-1}} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 2.6: Graphical solution for multistage CSTRs - first-order reaction Figure 2.6 shows a way to represent the material balances for each stage from a plot \\(1/(-r_A)\\) as a function of \\(C_A\\). Another interesting situation is finding the best setup to achieve a given conversion. Let us illustrate the use of this method considering two CSTRs in series under isothermal conditions, as shown in the Figure 2.7 Figure 2.7: Graphical representation of two CSTRs in series For the first CSTR, the design equation becomes \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{V_1}{F_{A0}} = \\frac{X_{A1}}{-r_A(X_{A1})} \\end{equation}\\] while for the second one is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{V_2}{F_{A0}} = \\frac{X_{A2} - X_{A1}}{-r_A(X_{A2})} \\end{equation}\\] These relations are graphically represented in the Figure 2.8. The cascade of CSTRs operates between known initial and final conversion levels, and the total reaction volume is represented by the sum of the shaded areas. Figure 2.8: Graphical representation of two CSTRs in series When the rectangle KLMN is made as large as possible, the overall volume is minimized. Therefore, point \\(X_{A1}\\) is the critical parameter to get the reactors’ optimal size. For reaction rate expressions of the _n_th-order form, it can be shown that there is always one and only one point that minimizes the total volume when \\(n&gt;0\\). (Hill and Root 2014) The total reaction volume is: \\[\\begin{equation} V_1 + V_2 = F_{A0}\\:\\frac{X_{A1}}{(-r_A)_1} + F_{A0}\\:\\frac{X_{A2} - X_{A1}}{(-r_A)_2} \\tag{2.22} \\end{equation}\\] The derivative of eq. #ref(eq:totalVolume) respects to \\(X_{A1}\\) is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{d\\:\\left(V_1 + V_2\\right)}{dX_{A1}} = \\frac{F_{A0}}{(-r_A)_1} + F_{A0}\\:X_{A1}\\left(\\frac{d\\:\\left(1/(-r_A)_1\\right)}{dX_{A1}}\\right) - \\frac{F_{A0}}{(-r_A)_2} = 0 \\end{equation}\\] simplifying leads to \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{d\\left(1/(-r_A)_1\\right)}{dX_{A1}} = \\frac{1/(-r_A)_2 - 1/(-r_A)_1}{dX_{A1}} \\end{equation}\\] Therefore, the minimum reaction volume will be found when the intermediate fractional conversion \\(X_{A1}\\) is selected. The slope of the reaction rate curve at this conversion level is equal to the slope of the rectangle’s diagonal KLMN, as is shown in figure 2.9. Figure 2.9: Graphical representation of the minimum total reaction volume for two CSTRs in series Generally, the optimum size ratio is dependent on the form of the reaction rate expression and on the conversion task specified. Table 2.1 summarizes the optimal configuration for CSTRs in series from a kinetic-order point of view. Table 2.1: Thumb-rules for optimal configuration for CSTRs in serie kinetic-order n Optimal configuration \\(n = 1\\) same size \\(n &gt; 1\\) first tank with &lt; volume \\(n &lt; 1\\) first tank with &gt; volume In engineering practice, the designer tends to select CSTRs with the same volume to minimize installation and operational costs. 2.4.3 Energy Balance Now let us find out how to apply the general energy balance (eq.(2.3)) to a CSTR. Usually, for an ideal CSTR operating at a steady-state (\\(dU/dt = 0\\)), it is considered the work done by the stirrer neglected, so the energy balance yields to: \\[\\begin{equation} Q - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} F_{i0} \\left( \\int_{T_0}^{T} C_{P_i} dT \\right) - \\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^r \\xi_j \\, \\Delta H_{R_j}(T) = 0 \\tag{2.23} \\end{equation}\\] From thermodynamics, we know that for a reaction \\(j\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\xi_j = \\frac{F_i - F_{i0}}{\\nu_i} = - \\frac{F_{i,0}\\,X_i}{\\nu_i} \\end{equation}\\] Thus \\[\\begin{equation} Q - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} F_{i0} \\left( \\int_{T_0}^{T} C_{P_i} dT \\right) + \\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^R {\\left(\\frac{F_{i,0}\\,X_i}{\\nu_i}\\right)}_j \\, \\Delta H_{R_j}(T) = 0 \\tag{2.24} \\end{equation}\\] This equation written for a reactant A (\\(\\nu_A=-1\\)), considering only one chemical reaction is taken place, becomes to \\[\\begin{equation} Q - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} F_{i0} \\left( \\int_{T_0}^{T} C_{P_i} dT \\right) - F_{A,0}\\,X_A \\, \\Delta H_{R}(T) = 0 \\tag{2.25} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} Q - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} F_{i0} \\left( \\int_{T_0}^{T} C_{P_i} dT \\right) + \\Delta H_{R}(T)\\,r_A\\,V = 0 \\tag{2.26} \\end{equation}\\] while for a product \\(P\\) \\[\\begin{equation} Q - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} F_{i0} \\left( \\int_{T_0}^{T} C_{P_i} dT \\right) + \\frac{\\nu_P}{\\nu_A}\\,F_{A,0}\\,X_A \\, \\Delta H_{R}(T) = 0 \\tag{2.27} \\end{equation}\\] Equation (2.25) (or (2.27)), if the system’s heat transfer characteristic is known, requires a reaction rate expression and the design equation to determine the fluid’s temperature and composition leaving the reactor. Using the energy balance to analyze the performance or sizing an ideal CSTR is not as complicated mathematically, so let us consider some typical heat transfer modes. 2.4.3.1 Jacket-Cooled Consider the ideal CSTR shown in Figure 2.10. Heat is added to or removed from the reactor by a heat-transfer fluid that flows through the jacket. Depending on the reactor temperature and whether the reactor is being heated or cooled, the heat-transfer fluid may be cooling water, chilled brine, chilled glycol solution, hot oil, or some other fluid. The fluid is a source of (or a sink for) the heat transferred through the reactor wall. Figure 2.10: Schematic diagram of an ideal CSTR with heat transfer through a heating/cooling jacket The transit energy rate is \\(\\dot{W}\\). The temperature of the fluid at a point in the jacket is \\(T_c\\). The fluid enters the jacket at \\(T_{c,i}\\) and leaves at \\(T_{c,o}\\). The feed enters the reactor at temperature \\(T_0\\). The molar flow rates of each component of the feed are designated \\(F_{i,0}\\), and its corresponding concentrations are designated \\(C_{i,0}\\). The reactor operates at a temperature, T, which is the effluent temperature too. The molar flow rates in the output stream are designated \\(F_i\\), and the corresponding concentrations are \\(C_i\\). If a single reaction occurs in a CSTR and one mole of reactant A is consumed in an elemental first-order reaction, the eq. (2.28) yields to: \\[\\begin{equation} Q - \\left(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\mathcal{C} F_{i0}\\,\\overline{C}_{p,i}\\right)\\left(T - T_0\\right) - F_{A0}\\,X_A \\, \\Delta H_{R}(T) = 0 \\tag{2.28} \\end{equation}\\] The Q term in eq. (2.28) depends on the removal scheme used. In general, the rate for heat transfer is: \\[\\begin{equation*} q = U \\left(T_c - T\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] where: q is the heat flux into the reactor \\(\\left(\\text{J}/\\text{m}^2-\\text{h}\\right)\\), and U means the overall heat-transfer coefficient \\(\\left(\\text{J}/\\text{m}^2-\\text{h}-\\text{K}\\right)\\). If \\(T&lt;Tc\\), heat is transferred into the reactor and \\(q&gt;0\\). The total heat transfer rate, Q, is obtained by integrating the flux, q, over the whole area of the exchanger. For example, if the temperature of the fluid is the same at every point in the exchanger. \\[\\begin{equation*} Q = U\\,A_{J} \\left(\\overline{T}_c - T\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(\\overline{T}_c\\) is the constant temperature of the heat-transfer fluid, and it is equal to the outlet temperature, \\(T_{c,o}\\), \\(A_J\\) is the total area of the heat exchanger.
