# Introducion {-}

This is an _online_ book written in **Markdown** and **LaTeX**. I delivered my personal notes that I used to use during my lectures on Chemical Reactor Design at the Central University of Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela.

Because it is a recompilation of notes, this material is not a comprehensive book where you will find details in concepts of the area. However, it is a relatively straightforward guide for an intermediate undergraduate student of Chemical Engineering.

Besides concepts and equations, I added several typical problems solved in Python. Most of the illustrations given are modifications of examples taken from textbooks like Fogler or Roberts.
