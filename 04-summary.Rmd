# Final Words

I reached the end of this notes compilation for one of my courses as a Chemical Engineering professor at the [Central University of Venezuela](http://www.ucv.ve). I am genuinely thankful for those 15 years dedicated to lecture (to) and learning from my students.

Being an academic advisor was one of the scariest things I had ever done. Every meeting, talk, demonstration, video lecture, code presentation was challenging, but in the end, an enriching task.

Thank you to all my students, professors, teammates for your support and encouragement to be a better human being.

Now, I will be a life learner and keep my dear Alma Mater as one of the priceless life experiences I have had.
